<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Okay, folks, we're moving along. We only have two more comedians left in our
>
> first half, so I don't want to waste some time.
>
> I want to bring up the next comedian of tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, this
>
> next comic, he's originally from the UK,
>
> but he's been living here for over 17 years, okay? And we are very happy to
>
> have him here. He is amazing.
>
> And ladies and gentlemen, this is his real name. Make some noise. It's Harry
>
> Fox, everybody. Give it up for Harry Fox. Give it up.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Books. It's a German name. It's spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox. And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halber and Gloppen.
>
> It's been a good start.
>
> But, you know, the real problem is, with a name like Harry Fox, is it sets a
>
> very high level of expectation.
>
> And honestly, I've really only known about this much about him. Well, actually
>
> about him.
>
> And in fact, recently, it's been, honestly, if I share this with you, it's been
>
> a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> This is an IT crowd. Put all of you.
>
> Put your hands up, motherfuckers.
>
> Hey, and I work in IT, too, you know. You cannot fuck with me. I know C.
>
> I will pop your stack, motherfuckers.
>
> No, but, you know, for those that are not in IT, maybe I can explain the
>
> condition that we're in.
>
> Because when you haven't had sex in a long time, it's a little bit like you're
>
> hallucinating.
>
> You know, you could be walking down the street.
>
> And you see a couple of dogs, like, sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them, and you think, uh, I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into Migros, and you spot an axioma on a watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon.
>
> You have two.
>
> Bah! It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> You've forgotten there are people looking at you.
>
> You haven't forgotten seeing me.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> And you look, and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, she's nice.
>
> But honestly, honestly, it gets worse.
>
> It gets worse because I don't know, even at this age, if I'm any good at sex.
>
> You know, yeah, thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Maybe, maybe you can test me later.
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> Because if I had it all up, maybe, maybe I'd get to 5,000 hours.
>
> If I include masturbation.
>
> But what's, to me, more depressing about this is, like, right now, right here
>
> in this room,
>
> all of you are listening.
>
> To me, wasting time.
>
> That means all of you must suck at sex, too.
>
> Especially all the IT guys.
>
> There's some righteous clapping from some ladies over there.
>
> Okay, but, no, the thing is, I actually, I got thinking about this.
>
> I did the maths, you know.
>
> And it's actually a really hard number to reach.
>
> Because if you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> Or, if you live to 70, you need to fuck ten times a day, from the day you were
>
> born,
>
> until the day you die.
>
> And I know what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking,
>
> or the idea of sex with old people.
>
> On the day they're dying.
>
> But at this moment, someone here, someone here is like, "This is bullshit. I
>
> know I'm good at sex."
>
> Like,
>
> Liam here, for example.
>
> Liam is like, "I study international affairs. I can have affairs
>
> internationally."
>
> Liam, I hate to tell you this, there are only two types of people that think
>
> they're good at sex.
>
> Prostitutes.
>
> And compulsive liars.
>
> Stop lying, Liam.
>
> You know you're a ho!
>
> Yeah, but, uh, you know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> This may be moved to a different...
>
> This may be moved to a different topic, because I think it's an especially hard
>
> time for women.
>
> Because, I read this statistic recently, and it said that in the age group 20
>
> to 40,
>
> in the last three months, almost 50% of men send someone a dick pic.
>
> That is a shocking number.
>
> I mean, ladies, that might be hard to visualize, but...
>
> Imagine if you gave your number to ten guys here.
>
> By Christmas time, you'll have a stack of dicks on your phone.
>
> You can just, like, print them out, give them as Christmas cards, like,
>
> decorate your tree.
>
> But, personally, I don't take dick pics myself.
>
> Now, that's not because I'm better than that.
>
> It's because taking a quality dick pic is hard.
>
> You know, there's a lot to think about.
>
> It's like, you've got to think about the lighting.
>
> Do I go for some soft, mellow things to bring out the fleshy tones?
>
> Maybe something a bit more red and erotic.
>
> Do I need props?
>
> Like, should I put a few roses around here to make it more romantic?
>
> And, you know, the angle is hard, too.
>
> It's like, how do you get that good angle?
>
> But, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur, and that's why I invented the dick pic
>
> selfie stick.
>
> And for you guys tonight, you can get it on dickpicselfiestick.com, $29.99.
>
> All right, I think that's where I'm leaving you.
>
> The lady with the laugh, the sheepy laugh here, is really distracting.
>
> But, please don't do that to a sheep.
>
> That's not okay.
>
> All right, I'm getting out of here.
>
> Have a great night.
>
> Hey, give it up again.
>
> That was Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Oh, my God, ladies and gentlemen.
