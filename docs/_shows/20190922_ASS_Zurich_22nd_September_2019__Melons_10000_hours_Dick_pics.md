<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Okay folks, we're moving along. We only have two more comedians left in our first half, so I don't
>
> want to waste some time, I want to bring up the next comedian of tonight.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, this next comic, he's originally from the UK, but he's been living here for
>
> over 17 years, okay?
>
> And we are very happy to have him here, he is amazing. And ladies and gentlemen, this is his real
>
> name. Make some noise, it's Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name, it's spelled F-U-C-K-S-R-E-P-F-U-C-K-S. But
>
> when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> But my name is not Harry Fux. And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them "Halberd" and "Walton" which isn't a good start, am I?
>
> But, you know, the real problem is, with a name like Harry Fux, is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> And honestly, I've really only done about this much about him. Well, actually about that much about
>
> him.
>
> And in fact, recently, it's been, honestly, if I share this with you, it's been a long time since I've
>
> had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> This is an IT crowd. Put all of you hands up, motherfuckers.
>
> Hey, and I work in IT too, you know. You cannot fuck with me. I know C. I will pop your stack,
>
> motherfuckers.
>
> No, but, you know, for those that are not in IT, maybe I can explain the condition that we're in.
>
> Because when you haven't had sex in a long time, it's a little bit like you're hallucinating, you
>
> know.
>
> You could be walking down the street and you see a couple of dogs, like, sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros and you spot an acción on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two. BAM. It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon. You've forgotten there are people looking at you.
>
> You're getting hot and steamy. And then you hear this, "Junge Mann, schämen Sie sich nicht."
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag and you think, "She's nice."
>
> But honestly, it gets worse. It gets worse because I don't know, even at this age, if I'm any good
>
> at sex.
>
> Thank you. Thank you. Maybe you can test me later.
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> Because if I added it all up, maybe, maybe I'd get to 5,000 hours, if I include masturbation.
>
> But what's to me more depressing about this is, like, right now, right here in this room,
>
> all of you are listening to me wasting time. That means all of you must suck at sex too.
>
> Especially all the IT guys.
>
> There's some righteous clapping from some ladies over there.
>
> Okay, but the thing is, actually, I got thinking about this. I did the maths, you know.
>
> And it's actually a really hard number to reach because if you fuck for 24 hours a day for an
>
> entire year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> Or if you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born until the day you
>
> die.
>
> And I know what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking,
>
> or the idea of sex with old people on the day they're dying.
>
> But at this moment, someone here, someone here is like, "This is bullshit. I know I'm good at sex."
>
> Like Liam here, for example.
>
> Liam is like, "I study international affairs. I can have affairs internationally."
>
> Liam, I hate to tell you this. There are only two types of people that think they're good at sex.
>
> Prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> Stop lying, Liam. You know you're at home.
>
> But you know, I don't know. Let's maybe move to a different topic.
>
> Because I think it's an especially hard time for women.
>
> Because I read this statistic recently, and it said that in the age group 20 to 40,
>
> in the last three months, almost 50% of men send someone a dick pic.
>
> That's a shocking number. I mean, ladies, that might be hard to visualize.
>
> But imagine if you gave your number to ten guys here.
>
> By Christmas time, you'll have a stack of dicks on your table.
>
> You can just print them out, give them as Christmas cards, and decorate your tree.
>
> But personally, I don't take dick pics myself.
>
> Now, that's not because I'm better than that. It's because taking a quality dick pic is hard.
>
> There's a lot to think about. It's like, you've got to think about the lighting.
>
> Do I go for some soft, mellow things to bring out the fleshy tones?
>
> Maybe something a bit more red and erotic.
>
> Do I need props? Like, should I put a few roses around here to make it more romantic?
>
> And, you know, the angle is hard, too. It's like, how do you get that good angle?
>
> But I'm a bit of an entrepreneur, and that's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> And for you guys tonight, you can get it on dickpicselfiestick.com, $29.99.
>
> Alright, I think that's where I'm leaving you.
>
> The lady with the sheepy laugh here is really distracting.
>
> Please, don't do that to a sheep. That's not okay.
>
> Alright, I'm getting out of here. Have a great night.
