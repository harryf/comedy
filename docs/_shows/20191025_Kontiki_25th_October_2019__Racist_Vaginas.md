> Okay, now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to bring up the first comic of our
>
> second half.
>
> He's very funny, ladies and gentlemen. He's been living here for a very long
>
> time, but originally he's from the UK.
>
> And yes, this name, his name, is completely real.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up, it's Harry Fox, everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name, it's spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Boy, I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you would think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Because in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them how-the and what-the.
>
> It's a hard life.
>
> But, you know, maybe we can immediately go, I need to share something with you,
>
> because, you know, not so long ago, I got dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> Thank you, I appreciate that. I was heartbroken.
>
> But on the plus side, it did make me an expert.
>
> I was an expert on all Swiss women.
>
> And what I learned is that Swiss women, they don't communicate very well,
>
> especially when it comes to their men.
>
> And the reason for this is that it wasn't until 1991 that the last canton of
>
> Appenzell-Innerhornden finally agreed to give women the right to have orgasms.
>
> So I thought, you know, maybe if there are any guys who you end up with a Swiss
>
> girlfriend, I prepared a few key phrases.
>
> So you can understand her better.
>
> For example, if she says to you, oh, shetsly, this is a good thing, this means
>
> there is a high chance of sexual favors, actually.
>
> But if she says, like, shuts, this is a bad thing, that means you should
>
> probably spend the night on the sofa.
>
> But if she says to you, poor guy, this is a good thing, this means I'm as horny
>
> as a whore.
>
> But if she says to you, lick mich doch am Arsch, under no circumstances should
>
> you try to lick her asshole.
>
> Unless, unless she says to you, das ist ein Schießdreck, in which case you
>
> could think about licking her asshole, but you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> Yeah, I know.
>
> But, you know, since then, since then, I'm currently facing a really hard
>
> decision.
>
> Because.
>
> I started seeing this other woman, it's very casual right now, just on and off,
>
> but yesterday, she asked me, for her birthday, if I would buy her a dildo.
>
> Now, first of all, I was like, oh, wow, I'm really touched.
>
> It's like our relationships reached a new level.
>
> But then I got online and I took a look, and I realized that choosing a dildo
>
> is really hard, you know.
>
> You've got a lot to think about, the size, the shape, the vibrational frequency.
>
> I've studied physics, I have to think about these things.
>
> And, you know, even the color.
>
> I don't even know what color would be appropriate.
>
> So I thought, maybe tonight, maybe tonight, I could ask the ladies here to help
>
> me out.
>
> Would you help me out with this problem?
>
> Because, you know, I know that you're all angels.
>
> You would never own a dildo.
>
> Well, except for Tamara, perhaps, because she's in a long-term relationship, a
>
> long distance.
>
> But, you know, just imagine this scenario.
>
> There's a terrorist bomb.
>
> It's going to go off.
>
> The only way to stop it is a dildo.
>
> Okay?
>
> Are you with me?
>
> Can you help me out?
>
> Would you help me out with this?
>
> Give me a little...
>
> Holy shit, what happened here?
>
> None of them own dildos here.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> Well, let me try this on you.
>
> So let me just ask you, like, we're going to test some color options.
>
> Like, blue.
>
> Would you buy a blue dildo?
>
> No.
>
> What about yellow?
>
> Would you take a yellow dildo?
>
> No.
>
> Okay, good.
>
> All right, let's try something a bit more realistic.
>
> What about something that's kind of peach or vanilla or light pink, you know?
>
> Would you choose that as a dildo?
>
> Is that what I should do?
>
> Okay, yeah.
>
> Thank you for being so open.
>
> Anyone else?
>
> Is this what I should do?
>
> Okay, let's just check.
>
> What about a black dildo?
>
> Okay.
>
> Wow, it's like a dildo pro over there.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Maybe we can talk about this later on.
>
> You can give me some good advice.
>
> But, you know, to me, what's really...
>
> I think I've learned what I needed to know from this.
>
> Because, ladies, what you've told me is that your vaginas are racist.
>
> Holy fuck.
>
> You had an option.
>
> You chose the white male patriarchal dildo.
>
> I am shocked.
>
> Because my dick...
>
> My dick is not racist, you know.
>
> Like, green, red, whatever, brown.
>
> My dick is just happy getting in anywhere.
>
> But these racist vaginas in here.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> What are you going to do?
>
> Are you going to build a wall here?
>
> Stop the Mexicans getting in?
>
> When we get a group of vaginas together,
>
> do you start wearing pointy hats and burning crosses?
>
> What the fuck?
>
> In your pants?
>
> Is there, like, a riot going on going,
>
> Make vaginas great again!
>
> Is that what's happening?
>
> I am shocked, ladies.
>
> You know, I am very shocked.
>
> Now you have equal pay.
>
> You could at least invest some of that money
>
> in genital equality.
>
> All right.
>
> I think I can't be on stage here anymore
>
> with all these racist vaginas.
>
> I'm shocked.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Good night.
>
> That was Barry Fox, everybody.
>
> Very nice.
>
> We have a very dirty video.
