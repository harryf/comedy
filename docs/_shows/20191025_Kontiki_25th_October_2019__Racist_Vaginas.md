> Okay, now. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to bring up the first comic of our second half.
>
> He's very funny, ladies and gentlemen. He's been living here for a very long time, but
>
> originally he's from the UK. And yes, this name, his name, is completely real. Ladies
>
> and gentlemen, give it up, it's Harry Fox, everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name, it's spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of people think my name is
>
> Harry Fox. My name is not Harry Fox. Because in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers. And I have two kids. I had to
>
> call them "how the" and "what the". It's a hard life. But you know, maybe we can immediately
>
> go, "I need to share something with you, because not so long ago, I got dumped by my first
>
> Swiss girlfriend." Thank you, I appreciate that. I was heartbroken, but on the plus side,
>
> it did make me an expert on all Swiss women. And what I learnt is that Swiss women, they
>
> don't communicate very well, especially when it comes to their men. And the reason for
>
> this is that it wasn't until 1991 that the last canton of Appenzell, Innerhorden, finally
>
> agreed to give women the right to have orgasms. So I thought, you know, maybe if there are
>
> any guys who you end up with a Swiss girlfriend, I prepared a few key phrases for you, so that
>
> you can understand her better. For example, if she says to you, "Oh, schätzli", this
>
> is a good thing. This means there is a high chance of sexual favors, actually. But if
>
> she says, "Schatz", this is a bad thing. That means you should probably spend the night
>
> on the sofa. But if she says to you, "Oh, le geil", this is a good thing. This means
>
> I'm as horny as a whore. But if she says to you, "Leck mich doch am Arsch", under no circumstances
>
> should you try to lick her asshole. Unless, unless she says to you, "Das ist ein Schießdreck",
>
> in which case you could think about licking her asshole, but you might be in for a nasty
>
> surprise. Yeah, I know. But, you know, since then, since then, I'm currently facing a really
>
> hard decision. Because I started seeing this other woman, it's very casual right now, just
>
> coming off, but yesterday she asked me, for her birthday, if I would buy her a dildo.
>
> Now, first of all, I was like, "Oh, wow, I'm really touched." I'd say, "Our relationships
>
> reached a new level." But then I got online and I took a look and I realized that choosing
>
> a dildo is really hard, you know. You've got a lot to think about. The size, the shape,
>
> the vibrational frequency. I studied physics, I have to think about these things. And, you
>
> know, even the color. I don't even know what color would be appropriate. So I thought maybe
>
> tonight, maybe tonight I could ask the ladies here to help me out. Would you help me out
>
> with this problem? Because, you know, I know that you're all angels. You would never own
>
> a dildo. Well, except for Tamara, perhaps, because she's in a long-term relationship,
>
> a long distance. But, you know, just imagine this scenario. There's a terrorist bomb. It's
>
> going to go off. The only way to stop it is a dildo. Okay? Are you with me? Can you help
>
> me out? Would you help me out, ladies? Give me a little, woo! Holy shit, what happened
>
> here? None of them own dildos here. Oh, my God. Well, let me try this on you. So let
>
> me just ask you, like, we're going to test some color options. Like blue. Would you buy
>
> a blue dildo? No. Okay. What about yellow? Would you take a yellow dildo? No. Okay, good.
>
> All right, let's try something a bit more realistic. What about something that's kind
>
> of peach or vanilla or light pink, you know? Would you choose that as a dildo? Is that
>
> what I should do? Yes. Okay. Thank you for being so open. Anyone else? Is this what I
>
> should do? Okay, let's just check. What about a black dildo? I'll get it. Wow, she looks
>
> like a dildo pro over there. Thank you. Maybe we can talk about this later on. You can give
>
> me some good advice. But, you know, to me, what's really, I think I've learned what I
>
> needed to know from this. Because, ladies, what you've told me is that your vaginas are
>
> racist. Holy fuck! You had an option. You chose the white male patriarchal dildo. I
>
> am shocked. Because my dick, my dick is not racist, you know, like green, red, whatever,
>
> brown. My dick is just happy getting it anyway. But these racist vaginas in here, oh my God.
>
> What are you going to do? Are you going to build a wall here, stop the Mexicans getting
>
> in? When we get a group of vaginas together, do you start wearing pointy hats and burning
>
> crosses in your pants? Is there like a riot going on, going, "Make vaginas great again"?
>
> Is that what's happening here? I am shocked, ladies, you know? I am very shocked. Now you
>
> have equal pay. You could at least invest some of that money in genital equality. All
>
> right. I think I can't be on stage here anymore with all these racist vaginas. I am shocked.
>
> Thank you. Good night.
