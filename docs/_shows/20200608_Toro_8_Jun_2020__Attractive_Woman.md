  Doing the attractive woman bit… there was a VERY angry woman at the front. So then I zagged to the bit about lesbians and fruit… there was a group of gay men at the back who enjoy the disaster. Was also the first time a really applied Patrice’s idea of “We’re all going to hell” when bombing

> So we have two more comics, and then after that we're going to take a little
>
> break, okay?
>
> So let's bring the next act on. Please make some noise for Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name. It's spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Excuse me, a lady there texting. I'm trying to explain my name right now. Save
>
> that for later on, please.
>
> Okay, thank you. That worked, I'm quite surprised.
>
> Alright, yeah.
>
> Now I gotta get, just gonna get the anger back.
>
> Yeah, so yeah, and in my family we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them "How the" and "What the".
>
> But let's see, the real problem with this name, the real problem with this name
>
> is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Like recently this American guy came up to me, he's like, "Yo, Harry Fuchs!
>
> Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I was like, "What?" And he's like, "Exactly, Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Okay, let me throw him off with some adverbs, like Harry Fuchs
>
> hopefully. Harry Fuchs occasionally. Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> And that, that threw him off. He was confused. American prejudices work in that.
>
> But before I continue, I need to make one thing clear.
>
> But before I continue, I need to make one thing clear.
>
> I identify as an attractive woman.
>
> I'm not gay, I just identify as an attractive woman for the benefits.
>
> In fact, I'll be at the bar after the show if you want to buy me a drink.
>
> And there are a lot of benefits to identifying as an attractive woman.
>
> Like recently I went into Starbucks.
>
> I ordered a green tea frappuccino.
>
> And the guy said, "What's your name?"
>
> And I said, "My name is Harry. I'm an attractive woman."
>
> And he said, "Well, hell, this drinks on the house."
>
> And I said, "Thank you. Please bring it to my table."
>
> Or recently I was driving and I was a bit over the limit.
>
> The police stopped me and they said, "We're gonna need some identity."
>
> And I said, "My identity is attractive woman."
>
> And they said, "Well, hey, you're free to go. After you've blown into this."
>
> Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't write these jokes.
>
> Some guy wrote them for me.
>
> Oh, okay. We've got a lot of "uh"s from that.
>
> Alright, but no, the thing is, I saw something recently, a statistic.
>
> If you didn't like what came up to now, it's just gonna get worse by the day.
>
> If you didn't like what came up to now, it's just gonna get worse by the day.

> If you didn't like what came up to now, it's just gonna get worse by the day.
>
> But I saw this statistic that only 1.1% of women identify as a lesbian.
>
> And I thought, "That number seems surprisingly low."
>
> Because, you know, ladies, we've all had that moment, you know, "I'm an
>
> attractive woman."
>
> Where you're just lying back, daydreaming, and there's some guy down here, like,
>
> fiddling around and getting it all wrong.
>
> You just think, "I wish there was another way."
>
> You just think, "I wish there was another way."

> You know, and I think the more I thought about this, the more I thought, you
>

>
> Because, you know, are lesbians really happy to be in the LGBT group?
>
> Because the Gs, the Bs, and the Ts, those guys really like ass-fucking.
