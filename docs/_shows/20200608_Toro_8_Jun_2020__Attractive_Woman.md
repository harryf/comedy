  Doing the attractive woman bit… there was a VERY angry woman at the front. So then I zagged to the bit about lesbians and fruit… there was a group of gay men at the back who enjoy the disaster. Was also the first time a really applied Patrice’s idea of “We’re all going to hell” when bombing

> So we have two more comics and then after that we're going to take a little break, okay?
>
> So let's bring the next act on. Please make some noise for Harry Fuchs!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name. It's spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Excuse me, lady there texting.
>
> I'm trying to explain my name right now. Save that for later on, please. Okay, thank you.
>
> That worked. I'm quite surprised.
>
> All right, yeah, now I've got to get - wait, I'm just going to get the anger back.
>
> Yeah, so yeah, and in my family we get very upset when you call us a group of f*ckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Hal-ther and Wat-ther.
>
> But see, the real problem with this name, the real problem with this name is I get a lot of
>
> stupid comments. Like recently this American guy came up to me. He's like, "Yo, Harry Fuchs! Harry
>
> Fuchs what, man?" And I was like, "What?" And he's like, "Exactly, Harry Fuchs what, man?" And I'm
>
> like, "Okay, let me throw him off with some adverbs like 'Harry Fuchs hopefully', 'Harry
>
> Fuchs occasionally', 'Harry Fuchs enthusiastically'." And that threw him off. He was
>
> confused. American prejudices work in there. But before I continue, I need to make one thing clear.
>
> I identify as an attractive woman. I'm not gay, I just identify as an attractive woman
>
> for the benefits. In fact, I'll be at the bar after the show if you want to buy me a drink.
>
> And there are a lot of benefits to identifying as an attractive woman. Like recently,
>
> I went into Starbucks. I ordered a green tea frappuccino. And the guy said, "What's your name?"
>
> And I said, "My name is Harry. I'm an attractive woman." And he said, "Well, Hal, this drink's on
>
> the house." And I said, "Thank you. Please bring it to my table." Or recently, I was driving and I
>
> was a bit over the limit. The police stopped me and they said, "We're going to need some identity."
>
> And I said, "My identity is attractive woman." And they said, "Well, Harry, you're free to go
>
> after you've blown into this."
>
> All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't write these jokes. Some guy wrote them for me.
>
> Oh, okay. We've got a lot of... Ah, that's fair enough.
>
> All right. Now, the thing is, I saw something recently, a statistic. If you didn't like what
>
> came up to now, it's just going to get worse, by the way. But I saw this statistic that only 1.1%
>
> of women identify as a lesbian. And I thought, "That number seems surprisingly low." Because,
>
> you know, ladies, we've all had that moment. I'm an attractive woman, where you're just lying back,
>
> daydreaming, and there's some guy down here fiddling around and getting it all wrong. You
>
> just think, "I wish there was another way." And I think the more I thought about this,
>
> the more I thought maybe the real issue is that lesbians, they've been put in the wrong group,
>
> because, you know, are lesbians really happy to be in the LGBT group?
>
> Because the G's, the B's, and the T's, those guys really like ass fucking.
>
> And lesbians, they're kind of like holding hands and drinking lemon tea. It seems like an odd mix.
>
> You know, I imagine an LGBT meetup, and the G's, the B's, and the T's are in the middle,
>
> and they're just discussing what lube to buy. And the lesbians, they're in the corner just
>
> doing some knitting, painting a bowl of fruit. I don't know, it's an odd mix, I just think.
>
> But I'm sorry, I hope I haven't offended any lesbians here tonight,
>
> because I don't want to get chased down the street by a horde of rampaging lesbians.
>
> Which, to me, is actually funny, not a very scary thought.
>
> You know, if I was running, I would probably be running, but not very fast.
>
> And I'd be like, "Please, no. I'm an attractive woman."
>
> All right, that's what I've got. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
>
> Thank you very much!
>
> Okay, so now we have one last coming before the break.
>
> Please, please, make some noise for Madeleine!
