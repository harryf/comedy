<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> The last comedian, are you ready?
>
> Our last comedian is originally from England.
>
> Half German, half English.
>
> The absolute brilliant combination.
>
> He has been living in Switzerland for a long time.
>
> He mainly comes from English.
>
> He is very funny.
>
> Please welcome Harry Fox!
>
> My name is Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> You write F-Ö-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-Ö-C-K-S.
>
> But because I grew up in England,
>
> many believe that my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> My family, when we meet,
>
> would be very annoyed if someone called us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two children.
>
> I had to call them "Haube" and "Woppe".
>
> But it's a good chance.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fox
>
> is that it sets very high expectations.
>
> And to be honest, I only had so much sex.
>
> To be honest, I only had so much sex.
>
> Actually, and in the last time I was allowed to share this,
>
> I didn't have any sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you didn't have sex either.
>
> Raise your hands.
>
> Of course.
>
> But otherwise everyone else...
>
> But I'm surprised.
>
> I didn't know that I would meet the Syrian nymphomaniac anonymously.
>
> Okay, then I'll tell you a little bit
>
> so that you can understand me better.
>
> So if you haven't had sex for a long time,
>
> it's as if you're hallucinating.
>
> So you walk down the street,
>
> see a couple of dogs,
>
> sniffing at each other's asses,
>
> and you think,
>
> "I want to be there too."
>
> Or you go to the micro,
>
> and you see an action on watermelons.
>
> You get one hand on this watermelon,
>
> maybe two.
>
> Suddenly you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's getting warm, it's getting hot,
>
> it doesn't matter who's watching.
>
> Then suddenly you hear,
>
> "Young man, are you ashamed?"
>
> And you look, there's an old lady.
>
> She wants to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think,
>
> "She's beautiful."
>
> But what makes it all so difficult,
>
> I recently found out.
>
> At my age, I still don't know
>
> if I'm good at having sex.
>
> Because I read,
>
> to be good at anything,
>
> it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> So if I summed it all up,
>
> I'm at 5,000 hours,
>
> if masturbation counts.
>
> But if you fuck 24 hours a day,
>
> for a whole year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> I calculated that too.
>
> Or if you live 70 years,
>
> you have to fuck 10 times a day.
>
> From the day you were born
>
> to the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse,
>
> the thought of little babies fucking
>
> or the idea of having sex with old people
>
> on the day they die.
>
> I think it's too dark, it's too dark.
>
> Yes, but...
>
> Actually, the reason why
>
> I've had so little sex lately
>
> is because I was dumped
>
> by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> Thank you, thank you.
>
> But as an advantage,
>
> I'm now an expert on all Swiss women.
>
> And one thing...
>
> Swiss women,
>
> they're not particularly good at communicating.
>
> Especially with men.
>
> The reason for that
>
> is that it was only until 1991
>
> that the last canton of Appenzell in Rome
>
> finally voted for women
>
> to have the right to orgasm.
>
> But what I learned from that...
>
> I thought, if any other man
>
> finds himself in the same situation...
>
> I have a few important sentences
>
> that might help you
>
> to understand your Swiss girlfriend.
>
> For example, when she says,
>
> "Oh, darling."
>
> That's a good thing.
>
> That means, maybe later
>
> there will be a sexual experience.
>
> But if she says, "Honey!"
>
> That's a bad thing.
>
> You'll probably have to spend the night
>
> with her.
>
> But if she says, "Oh, honey!"
>
> That's a good thing.
>
> That means, she's as hot as a honey.
>
> But if she says, "Lick my ass!"
>
> Under no circumstances
>
> should she lick your ass.
>
> Unless she says,
>
> "That's a piece of shit, man!"
>
> And that means,
>
> you could lick her ass,
>
> but maybe there will be
>
> a bad surprise.
>
> How's the time going?
>
> Everything's fine.
>
> I'll just keep going.
>
> I think, right now,
>
> it's a difficult time for dating.
>
> Especially for women.
>
> Because I read recently,
>
> that almost 50% of men,
>
> all men, in the years 20 to 40,
>
> have sent a dick pic in the last 3 months.
>
> Yes, and that's perhaps
>
> a difficult number to understand.
>
> But, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> if you give your number
>
> to 10 men in this room,
>
> before Christmas,
>
> you'll have a stack of 5 dick pics
>
> on your phone.
>
> That could be expressed
>
> as Christmas cards,
>
> to decorate your arm.
>
> Yes.
>
> I think he looks a bit dicky, too.
>
> With this t-shirt.
>
> But I personally,
>
> I personally don't send dick pics.
>
> Not because I think it's bad,
>
> but because I'm a perfectionist.
>
> Because making a good dick pic
>
> is difficult.
>
> You have to think about a lot of things.
>
> For example, the light.
>
> Do I need a nice, warm color
>
> to bring out the main color,
>
> or more of something red and reddish?
>
> And, well, maybe I need
>
> some kind of shadow,
>
> a bit of pink around it, maybe.
>
> Is it dangerous?
>
> It has thorns,
>
> that could be dangerous.
>
> But above all,
>
> you have to think about the angle of view,
>
> because it's a selfie.
>
> Do I have to do it from here,
>
> or here, or there?
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> Luckily, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur,
>
> that's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> For all of you,
>
> tonight, dickpicselfiestick.com,
>
> at 9.29, 9.90.
>
> Do I have more time?
>
> Do something, Veggie.
>
> Okay, oh, it goes on.
>
> Yes, well,
>
> I'm sorry it's such a funny joke,
>
> but actually, the reason for it is,
>
> when I was little,
>
> something got taken away from me.
>
> Exactly, I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, when I listen to this reaction,
>
> I understand,
>
> nobody here knows what circumcision is.
>
> We'll talk about it later,
>
> I can show it to you.
>
> But what was a very bad childhood experience for me,
>
> when I grew up,
>
> it became a real advantage,
>
> because on the rare moments,
>
> when a woman finds her head next to my penis,
>
> she always frowns like this.
>
> And I ask her,
>
> why are you frowning on my penis?
>
> And she says,
>
> you have no idea,
>
> how many dirty snowflakes there are out there.
>
> Oh, I'm sorry.
>
> I'm sorry I had to say that.
>
> Okay, I'll correct it for you.
>
> Because, what I understood,
>
> for many uncircumcised men,
>
> there is far too little attention in this area.
>
> And that's why I'll end with a few tips,
>
> that will annoy your girlfriend today.
>
> For example, in the car,
>
> do you know this colorful tree?
>
> You can just hang it from your penis.
>
> The professional scene of women is very strong,
>
> that will help you immediately.
>
> What you could also do,
>
> is to make a nice tattoo on the top of your penis.
>
> For example, a field full of green grass and flowers,
>
> or a tree with birds,
>
> something like that,
>
> so that she doesn't have to look at these terrible blinks anymore.
>
> But there is a very simple solution.
>
> You just have to bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while she's down there,
>
> you can just feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes well with crackers.
>
> Yes, that's nice.
>
> I know now,
>
> no one will get sex tonight.
>
> We're on the same team now.
>
> Okay, thank you.
