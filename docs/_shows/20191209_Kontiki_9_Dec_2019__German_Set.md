<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Are you ready for the last comedian?
>
> Our last comedian is originally from England,
>
> half German, half English.
>
> The absolutely brilliant combination.
>
> He's been living in Switzerland for a long time,
>
> especially when it comes to English.
>
> He's super funny.
>
> Please welcome Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> You write F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat: F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But because I grew up in England,
>
> many people think that my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> My family, when we meet,
>
> would be very annoyed
>
> if someone called us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two children.
>
> I had to call them "how the" and "what the"
>
> but it's a good chance to have one.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fox
>
> is that it sets very high expectations.
>
> And to be honest, I've only had so much sex.
>
> To be honest, I've only had so much sex.
>
> Actually, and the last scene,
>
> if I may share that,
>
> I didn't have any sex.
>
> Hands up if you didn't have any sex either.
>
> The last scene.
>
> Okay.
>
> Of course.
>
> But other than that...
>
> But I'm sorry.
>
> I didn't know that I would come to
>
> such a nymphomaniac anonymous meeting.
>
> Okay, then I'll tell you a little bit
>
> so that you can understand me better.
>
> So if you haven't had sex in a long time,
>
> it's wrong as if you hallucinate.
>
> So you walk down the street,
>
> see a couple of dogs,
>
> they sniff your ass,
>
> and you think,
>
> "I want to go too."
>
> Or you go into the bathroom
>
> and you see an action on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on this watermelon,
>
> maybe two,
>
> and suddenly you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's getting warm, it's getting hot,
>
> it doesn't matter who's watching.
>
> Then suddenly you hear,
>
> "Young man, shame on you!"
>
> And you look, there's an old lady,
>
> and she's going to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think,
>
> "Looks nice."
>
> Yes, but...
>
> What made it all so difficult,
>
> in the last scene I got to know,
>
> in my age,
>
> I still don't know
>
> if I'm good at having sex.
>
> Because I've read,
>
> to be good at anything,
>
> it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> So if I were to sum it all up,
>
> maybe I'm at 5,000 hours,
>
> if masturbation counts.
>
> But I have...
>
> So if you get 24 hours a day for a whole year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> I've calculated that.
>
> Or if you live 70 years,
>
> you have to click 10 times a day.
>
> From the day you were born,
>
> to the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse,
>
> the thought of little babies that fuck,
>
> or the idea of having sex with old people.
>
> On the day they die.
>
> But it's too dark for us.
>
> It's too dark.
>
> Yes, but...
>
> Actually,
>
> the reason why I've had so little sex lately,
>
> is that,
>
> in the end,
>
> I was dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> Thank you, thank you.
>
> But as an advantage,
>
> I'm now an expert on all Swiss women.
>
> And one thing that...
>
> Swiss women,
>
> they're not particularly good at communicating.
>
> Especially...
>
> Yes, exactly.
>
> Especially to their men.
>
> The reason for that is,
>
> it was only until 1991,
>
> that the last canton of Appenzell in Rome,
>
> finally voted,
>
> that women have the right to orgasms.
>
> And...
>
> But what I assumed from that,
>
> I thought,
>
> if any other man finds himself in the same situation...
>
> So,
>
> I have a few important sentences,
>
> that might help you,
>
> to understand your Swiss girlfriend.
>
> For example,
>
> if she says,
>
> "Oh, honey,
>
> that's something good,
>
> that means,
>
> because later on,
>
> there will be a sexual experience."
>
> But if she says,
>
> "Honey,
>
> that's something bad,
>
> you'll probably have to spend the night on the couch."
>
> But if she says,
>
> "Hurray,
>
> that's something good,
>
> that means,
>
> she's as horny as a whore."
>
> And if she says,
>
> "Hurray,
