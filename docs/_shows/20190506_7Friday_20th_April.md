<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> - Yeah, so, my name is actually Harry Hooks.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But we have English speakers in the room
>
> and you guys think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset if you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> I have two kids.
>
> I call them Howler and Wadler.
>
> Always giving me a good start in life.
>
> But it's hard, it's hard to have this name
>
> because, you know, always stupid things are happening.
>
> Recently, this American tourist came up to me
>
> and he was like, "Yo, Harry Fox, man.
>
> "Harry Fox what?
>
> "Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Hmm, okay, let me see
>
> "if I can throw him off with some adverbs.
>
> "Harry fucks hopefully.
>
> "Harry fucks occasionally.
>
> "Harry fucks enthusiastically."
>
> He's like, "No, man, no, Harry fucks goats, man.
>
> "Harry fucks chickens.
>
> "Harry fucks tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you,
>
> but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of man,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And in fact, probably a few got fucked up by tigers.
>
> But this made me realize that
>
> there's actually a whole category of unfuckable animals.
>
> You know, like take hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you might get up behind a hippo and think,
>
> "Hmm, yeah, that's a great answer to slide in there,"
>
> but don't do it.
>
> Hippos will fuck you up.
>
> They are the most dangerous animal in Africa.
>
> They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> A lady here having issues with hippo fucking.
>
> Sorry about that.
>
> But it's true.
>
> Another animal you can't fuck is elephants.
>
> It's just too high up, you know?
>
> It's like, "I can't reach that."
>
> Okay, some guy at the back said, "I could do that."
>
> He's lying.
>
> But, you know, it's like, it's tough.
>
> But maybe if the mom isn't watching,
>
> you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Okay, good.
>
> Good.
>
> I'm just finding your level.
>
> I'm finding your level.
>
> What I'm seeing, what I'm hearing,
>
> is that you're okay with bestiality,
>
> not pedophile bestiality.
>
> I'm gonna stay away from that for the rest of the show.
>
> Relax.
>
> But I have to confess,
>
> I do have a lot of dark thoughts going on in my head,
>
> a lot of twisted stuff.
>
> And I think it goes back to my childhood.
>
> I went to a Catholic school,
>
> but I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> Okay, Catholic pedophiles were kind of okay there, okay?
>
> Because, you know, recently I watched this movie Spotlight.
>
> I don't know if you've seen this.
>
> It's about the priest molesting kids in Boston.
>
> It's a really disturbing movie.
>
> You know, there's priests that'll do it
>
> and they're quiet boys.
>
> It's fucked up.
>
> And got me thinking, like, you know,
>
> and this list of 10 commandments,
>
> where they have, like, don't worship false idols,
>
> don't be jealous of your neighbor's wife,
>
> and maybe don't fuck your neighbor's kids.
>
> Maybe they should have had that on there, you know?
>
> When Moses went up the mountain and he was like,
>
> "Okay, here's a list of things.
>
> "But Lord, shouldn't we put something on here
>
> "about kid fucking and this is kind of uncool?"
>
> And Lord's like, "I don't need to put that on there.
>
> "Obviously no one's gonna do that.
>
> "That's sick."
>
> But now, you know, if I was God,
>
> I would be really fucking angry.
>
> I'd be wanting to send a sign.
>
> Maybe light the fire or two, I don't know.
>
> Maybe burn a few churches.
>
> Maybe it was a sign, I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> No, honestly, I think what's fucked me up
>
> is actually not anything that happened in my childhood.
>
> It's actually 'cause I'm a dad.
>
> Two kids, they're teenagers now.
>
> And I've been through the whole thing of parenting
>
> and it really is hard and tough.
>
> You know, I was there when the kids were born.
>
> I was in the room.
>
> And, you know, in the good old days,
>
> men could just go to the pub and drink whiskey
>
> and smoke cigars.
>
> Now you've gotta be there supporting your loved one.
>
> And I was behind her, holding her,
>
> supporting her, calming her down.
>
> And at a certain point, the nurse said,
>
> "Hey, I can see the head.
>
> "Do you wanna come 'round here and have a look?"
>
> Advice to all the guys here, the correct answer is no.
>
> You do not want to look.
>
> 'Cause if you go 'round there and look,
>
> you're gonna see something
>
> that's gonna traumatize you for life.
>
> 'Cause that part of your loved one,
>
> that thing you like the most,
>
> just got turned into the Gotthard Tunnel.
>
> And like the Gotthard Tunnel,
>
> in future it's gonna take you a really long time
>
> to get in there.
>
> And once you're inside,
>
> you're gonna be kind of bored,
>
> maybe falling asleep.
>
> And you're probably wishing,
>
> "Gee, I wish I'd taken that second time at the end."
>
> Here we go, some of the people got that one,
>
> you sick individuals.
>
> But, you know, I mean, honestly,
>
> the thing for me as a father is realizing
>
> how much society, what it tells you about babies
>
> is completely different to the experience.
>
> And, you know, a good example of this is,
>
> you know, like, have you ever seen a group of young women
>
> and one of them's just had a child
>
> and they're all there going,
>
> "Oh, so cute, so sweet, oh.
>
> "I just love the way babies smell."
>
> I hate to break it to you,
>
> but that is not the smell of a baby.
>
> That is a smell of something that just spent nine months
>
> in your friend's vagina.
>
> And what you should really be saying is,
>
> "Oh, so cute, so sweet.
>
> "I just love the smell of your vagina."
>
> Okay, I think that has traumatized you enough.
>
> You've had enough trauma, I think I'm gonna end there.
>
> You've been great for tolerating this.
>
> I might quick get up here before the film.
>
> Give it up again for Harry.
