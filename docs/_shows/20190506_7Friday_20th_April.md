<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Yeah, so my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But we have English speakers in the room, and you guys think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs. In my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get
>
> very upset if you call us a group of fuckers. I have two kids. I call them Halva
>
> and Wadda.
>
> It's been a good start in life. But it's hard to have this name, because, you
>
> know,
>
> always stupid things are happening. Recently, this American tourist came up to
>
> me, and he
>
> was like, yo, Harry Fuchs, man. Harry Fuchs.
>
> What? Harry Fuchs what, man? I'm like, what? He's like, Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> And I was like, hmm. Okay, let me see if I can throw him off with some adverbs.
>
> Harry Fuchs hopefully. Harry Fuchs occasionally. Harry Fuchs enthusiastically.
>
> He's like, no, man, no. Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens. Harry Fuchs
>
> tigers.
>
> Now, I don't know about you.
>
> I don't know about you. But I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of man,
>
> no one
>
> has ever successfully fucked a tiger. And in fact, probably a few got fucked up
>
> by tigers.
>
> But this made me realize that there's actually a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals. You
>
> know, like, take hippos, for example. Now, you may get up behind a hippo and
>
> think, hmm,
>
> yeah, that's a great answer. Just slide in there. But don't do it. Hippos will
>
> fuck you
>
> up. They are the most dangerous animal in Africa. They kill about 500 people
>
> every year.
>
> A lady here having issues with hippo fucking. Sorry about that. But it's true.
>
> Another animal
>
> you can't fuck is elephants. Just too high up, you know. Can't reach that. Okay,
>
> some
>
> guy at the back said, I could do that. He's lying. But, you know, it's like, it's
>
> tough.
>
> But maybe if the mom isn't watching, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Okay, good. Good. I'm just finding your level. I'm finding your level. What I'm
>
> seeing, what
>
> I'm hearing is that you're okay with bestiality, not pedophile bestiality. I'm
>
> going to stay
>
> away from that for the rest of the show, right? And, but I have to confess, I
>
> do have a lot
>
> of dark thoughts going on in my head, a lot of twisted stuff. And I think it
>
> goes back
>
> to my childhood. I went to a Catholic school, but I got thrown out for molesting
>
> a priest.
>
> Okay. Catholic pedophiles were kind of okay there. Okay. Because, you know,
>
> recently I
>
> watched this movie Spotlight. I don't know if you've seen this. It's about the
>
> priests
>
> molesting kids in Boston. It's a really disturbing movie. You know, there's,
>
> there's priests
>
> that are doing their choir boys. It's fucked up. And got me thinking like, you
>
> know, and
>
> this list of 10 commandments where they have like, don't worship false idols.
>
> Don't, don't
>
> be jealous of people. Don't be jealous of people. Don't be jealous of people.
>
> Don't
>
> be jealous of your neighbor's wife. And maybe don't fuck your neighbor's kids.
>
> Maybe
>
> they should have had that on there. You know, when Moses went up the mountain
>
> and he was
>
> like, okay, here's a list of things. But Lord, shouldn't we put something on
>
> here about kid
>
> fucking? This is kind of uncool. And Lord's like, I don't need to put that on
>
> there. Obviously
>
> no one's going to do that. That's sick. But now, you know, if I was God, I
>
> would be really
>
> fucking angry. I'd be wanting to send a sign. Maybe like, I don't know, I don't
>
> know. I
>
> don't know. Maybe light a fire or two. I don't know. Maybe burn a few churches.
>
> Maybe
>
> it was a sign. I don't know. I don't know. No, honestly, I think, but honestly,
>
> I think
>
> what's fucked me up isn't actually not anything happened in my childhood. It's
>
> actually because
>
> I'm a dad. Two kids, they're teenagers now. And I've been through the whole
>
> thing of parenting
>
> and it really is hard and tough. You know, I was there when the kids were born.
>
> I was
>
> in the room. And, you know, I was there when the kids were born. I was in the
>
> room. And,
>
> you know, I was there when the kids were born. I was in the room. And, you know,
>
> I was
>
> in the room. And, you know, I was in the room. And, you know, I was in the room.
>
> And
>
> the good old days, men could just go to the pub and drink whiskey and smoke cigars.
>
> Now
>
> you've got to be there supporting your loved one. And I was behind her, holding
>
> her, supporting
>
> her, calming her down. And at a certain point, the nurse said, hey, I can see
>
> the head. Do
>
> you want to come around here and have a look? Advice to all the guys here, the
>
> correct answer
>
> is no. You do not want to look. Because if you go around there and look, you're
>
> going
>
> to see something that's going to trouble you. You're going to see something
>
> that's going
>
> to trouble you. You're going to see something that's going to trouble you. You're
>
> going
>
> to see something that's going to traumatize you for life. Because that part of
>
> your loved
>
> one, that thing you like the most, just got turned into the Gotthard Tunnel.
>
> And like
>
> the Gotthard Tunnel, in the future, it's going to take you a really long time
>
> to get in there.
>
> And once you're inside, you're going to be kind of bored, maybe falling asleep.
>
> And
>
> you're probably wishing, shit, I wish I'd taken that second tunnel up, you know?
>
> Here
>
> we go.
>
> You've got some of the people got that one, you sick individuals. But, you know,
>
> I mean,
>
> honestly, the thing for me as a father is realizing how much society, what it
>
> tells
>
> you about babies, is completely different to the experience. And, you know, a
>
> good example
>
> of this is, you know, like, have you ever seen a group of young women, and one
>
> of them's
>
> just had a child, and they're all there going, oh, so cute, so sweet, oh, I
>
> just love the
>
> way babies smell.
>
> I hate to break it to you, but that is not the smell of a baby. That is a smell
>
> of something
>
> that just spent nine months in your friend's vagina. And what you should really
>
> be saying
>
> is, oh, so cute, so sweet, I just love the smell of your vagina.
>
> Okay, I think that is, I've traumatized you enough. You've had enough trauma, I
>
> think
>
> I'm going to end there. You've been great for tolerating this. I might quit
>
> that up
>
> here before.
>
> Get up again for Harry Potter.
