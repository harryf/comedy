<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> We only have three more acts left in tonight's show, so let's bring up the next
>
> act.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, he's originally from the UK, but he's been living here in
>
> Switzerland for 17 years.
>
> And yes, this is his real name. Give it up, folks! It's Harry Fuchs, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when
>
> you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them 'how the' and 'what the'.
>
> I had to give them a starting line.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is I get a lot of stupid
>
> comments.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist, he came up to me and he was like,
>
> "Yo, Harry Fuchs! Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> And he's like, "Exactly. Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Okay, let me throw him off with some adverbs."
>
> "Harry Fuchs hopefully. Harry Fuchs occasionally. Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> And he's like, "No, man. No, Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens.
>
> Harry Fuchs tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of
>
> mankind, no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> In fact, what this made me realize is that there is a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals.
>
> Like, take hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you may get up behind a hippo and be like, "Mmm, that is a sweet ass if
>
> you just..."
>
> Don't do it. Don't do it.
>
> Hippos are very dangerous. They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants, for example, you know, 'cause it's just like too high up.
>
> You can't reach.
>
> Of course, if the mom isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> All right, I'm sorry. I'm just finding your level, you know?
>
> I've got it. You're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality, okay?
>
> I will try and stay away from that.
>
> Okay, let's pick a nice safe topic, like Christmas.
>
> Did you guys have a nice Christmas?
>
> Yeah!
>
> Really?
>
> Well, I had a shitty Christmas.
>
> 'Cause, you know, I was feeling kind of sad and depressed and, you know, and I
>
> did what a real man does under these circumstances.
>
> I got on YouTube and watched animal videos, and wow, and I discovered an animal
>
> that blew my mind.
>
> Wow, this animal is so fantastic. I can hardly believe it's taken me my whole
>
> life to find it.
>
> Kevin, can you guess what this animal is?
>
> Yes!
>
> He's still thinking about baby elephants.
>
> Stop that!
>
> Kevin, we're not doing that anymore.
>
> Jesus.
>
> No, uh, no, the animal that I'm talking about, it's actually, it's called the
>
> Argonaut octopus.
>
> Now, I've got to do a bit of explaining here, because the female Argonaut
>
> octopus is very aggressive.
>
> If a male gets anywhere near her, she's going to eat it, you know?
>
> The males are terrified of the females.
>
> I think, a bit like No-Name over there, she's pretty fucking terrified.
>
> But the male has developed a unique solution, and I'm going to try to do Albert's
>
> David Attenborough impression, okay?
>
> Bear with me, it's probably not going to be so good.
>
> It's like, the male of the species spots a female, and then he detaches his
>
> penis, it swims through the water, and homes in on her vagina.
>
> I kid you not.
>
> I kid you not.
>
> There is an octopus out there, let me just put that in layman's terms, it has a
>
> detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> If you don't believe me, Google this shit, it's real.
>
> And this blew my mind, and then I just thought, wow, this is fantastic.
>
> Can you imagine if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> It would change everything, you know?
>
> It's like, you know, it's Monday morning, you know, and like, Hannah, for
>
> example.
>
> She stood at the tram stop on the way to Google, thinking about all the
>
> engineers she's going to reject today.
>
> And she's just looking at her phone, and BAM! This dick just snaps her in the
>
> face.
>
> And she's like, "Oh fuck!"
>
> She hides behind some old ladies to throw it up, she gets down, she pulls out
>
> her Google dick shield, dicks are flying all around.
>
> The dick's slapping, going, "pfft, pfft, pfft."
>
> Like, Aaron there, he sees an American lady, he just fires his dick at her.
>
> It's like anarchy.
>
> Hannah jumps on the tram, she arrives at Google, and it's like, finally safe.
>
> Because there's a sign saying, "Please do not detach your penis during office
>
> hours."
>
> It's really crazy shit, it's crazy.
>
> I've been thinking a lot about this all Christmas, you know?
>
> The things that would be if we had detachable dicks.
>
> We'd probably have dick sports, you know?
>
> You'd have, like, dick racing at the Olympics.
>
> You've got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike starts sponsoring dicks.
>
> Women are out on the streets carrying signs saying, "Don't do it!"
>
> It's gonna be crazy, you know?
>
> And the more I think about it, it's just more questions.
>
> It's even more questions than what would happen if we had universal basic
>
> income.
>
> You know, because can you imagine?
>
> Like, for example, you know, let's say you, what if you lost your dick?
>
> You're crazy with that, but you just have to get out your phone, find my penis.
>
> Could you borrow your friend's dick?
>
> I wasn't cheating, it was his dick, you know?
>
> I just borrowed that shit.
>
> Or you had a hard night drinking, you get up, you find your dick in the corner,
>
> you're like, "What the fuck is that? Gross! Jesus!"
>
> It's some crazy shit.
>
> But what, can you imagine? What if? What if this?
>
> What if, when you fire your dick, it's a one-time only thing, and then it takes
>
> three months for your dick to regrow?
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> You know, that would change everything.
>
> Because, like, women, when they were talking to each other, they'd go, "Oh, it
>
> was so romantic. He gave me his dick."
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> Or, you know, like, her son's talking to his dad, saying, "Do I really have to
>
> give my dick away?"
>
> And dad is like, "Son, what?"
>
> And he's like, "Son, when you meet the right woman, you'll know."
>
> You know, or couples, like Kevin and Sarah, you know?
>
> You ask them how long they've been together, they don't tell you years.
>
> They're like, "We've been together," says Sarah, "for about 18 dicks."
>
> And Kevin's like, "How gay! It was 19 dicks, Sarah! Didn't you notice? Oh my
>
> God!"
>
> So anyway, so that's how I spent Christmas contemplating the dick-hop-a-lips.
>
> All right, I'm done. Thank you. You've been fun.
>
> Give it up, that was Harry Fox, everybody!
