<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> That was a weird way to finish the set.
>
> If I was a guy, I would have killed myself.
>
> Thank you, everybody.
>
> Good night.
>
> Suicide.
>
> Good night, everybody.
>
> Folks, we almost made it to the end of the show.
>
> Okay, we only have one last comedian left.
>
> After the show is over, this is a donation-based show.
>
> Okay, we make these free shows possible with your donations.
>
> So I'll be standing right there between those two pillars after the show
>
> with a little donation box.
>
> So please give it so we can do it.
>
> But enough of that now.
>
> I think we're ready for our last comedian of tonight.
>
> Trotar, are you guys ready?
>
> Let's break up this room.
>
> This is one side of the room.
>
> This is one side of the room.
>
> And you're the third group.
>
> Okay, cool?
>
> This side of the room, are you ready?
>
> This side of the room, are you ready?
>
> This guy, are you ready?
>
> You ruined it.
>
> I'm joking.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for your last comedian tonight.
>
> It's Harry Fox.
>
> Give it up for him.
>
> I'm just going to wait.
>
> Can you, can you do something about this?
>
> Okay.
>
> I appreciate the warm welcome.
>
> So my name is Harry.
>
> And I suffer from PPS.
>
> That's perfect penis syndrome.
>
> I'm also the most humble person I know.
>
> And it's hard.
>
> It's hard to be this humble when your penis is this perfect.
>
> Sometimes in, sometimes I go to the supermarket, I go to the vegetable section,
>
> I find the
>
> cucumbers and I stare them down just to let them know I'm not intimidated.
>
> And actually, I only discovered that I suffer from PPS last Christmas, because
>
> I met this lady, she was a bit of an expert, a dick-spert, if you will.
>
> And when she told me, wait, wait, hold on a second, could you, could you keep
>
> up with the jokes, please?
>
> You're throwing off the whole rhythm here.
>
> Okay.
>
> Let's just return, she told me that I suffer from PPS and I was shocked.
>
> I was stunned because I needed that information 30 years ago.
>
> It could have changed my life.
>
> I could have been like a pool boy or a pizza delivery guy or a snake charmer or
>
> something.
>
> I don't know.
>
> Instead, I have spent my whole life working with computers.
>
> I've been working with entirely the wrong.
>
> Hardware all these years.
>
> Okay.
>
> A weak reaction to that and expected more.
>
> Can I call it a new joke?
>
> Yeah, sure.
>
> I read, I heard something recently, I read something and this is real.
>
> It blew my mind.
>
> So some psychologists studying men, they figured out that men only reach
>
> emotional and mental maturity at the age of 40.
>
> 43.
>
> That is crazy.
>
> I'm like, I'm like a four year old.
>
> I think this lady here understands what I'm talking about.
>
> It's unusual.
>
> I mean, actually, when you think about this, it just, I do, sir, I just want to
>
> say I love
>
> the lesbian haircut.
>
> I'm with you there.
>
> How, how old are you, sir?
>
> I'm 42.
>
> 42.
>
> Okay.
>
> You're out there.
>
> So you're one year to go.
>
> You're going to be there.
>
> You know, and sometimes when I see a young couple, you know, you're going to be
>
> there.
>
> You're going to be there.
>
> You know, you're going to be there.
>
> You're going to be there.
>
> You're going to be there.
>
> You know, I just think, okay, so women apparently reach maturity at 32.
>
> That's 11 years before men, 11 years.
>
> So when you see a couple that's 24, that's actually like a 13 year old with
>
> someone that
>
> has a strange love of young boys.
>
> It is a very weird thing.
>
> It actually changes your whole perspective on anything like weddings, for
>
> example, you
>
> know, like, oh, I'm going to be a man.
>
> I'm going to be a woman.
