<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> That was a weird way to finish the set.
>
> If I was a guy, I would have killed myself.
>
> Thank you, everybody.
>
> Good night.
>
> Good night.
>
> Suicide.
>
> Good night, everybody.
>
> Folks, we almost made it to the end of the show.
>
> Okay, we only have one last comedian left.
>
> After the show is over, this is a donation-based show.
>
> Okay, we make these free shows possible with your donations.
>
> So I'll be standing right there between those two pillars
>
> after the show with a little donation box.
>
> So please give it so we can do it.
>
> But enough of that now.
>
> I think we're ready for our last comedian of tonight.
>
> Toronto, are you guys ready?
>
> Let's break up this room.
>
> This is one side of the room.
>
> This is one side of the room.
>
> And you're the third group, okay?
>
> Cool?
>
> This side of the room, are you ready?
>
> - Yeah!
>
> - This side of the room, are you ready?
>
> - Ready!
>
> - This guy, are you ready?
>
> - Yeah!
>
> - You ruined it.
>
> I'm joking.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for your last comedian tonight.
>
> It's Harry Fox, give it up for him!
>
> - Nothing happened, William.
>
> - I'm just gonna wait.
>
> - Can you do something about it?
>
> Okay.
>
> I appreciate the warm welcome.
>
> So my name is Harry.
>
> And I suffer from PPS.
>
> Perfect Penis Syndrome.
>
> I'm also the most humble person I know.
>
> And it's hard, it's hard to be this humble
>
> when your penis is this perfect.
>
> Sometimes I go to the supermarket,
>
> I go to the vegetable section,
>
> I find the cucumbers and I stare them down
>
> just to let them know I'm not intimidated.
>
> And actually I only discovered that I suffer from PPS
>
> last Christmas.
>
> Because I met this lady, she was a bit of an expert,
>
> a dick-spert, if you will.
>
> And when she told me...
>
> Wait, wait, hold on a second.
>
> Could you keep up with the jokes, please?
>
> You're throwing off the whole rhythm here.
>
> Okay, let's just return.
>
> She told me that I suffer from PPS.
>
> And I was shocked, I was stunned,
>
> because I needed that information 30 years ago.
>
> It could have changed my life.
>
> I could have been like a pool boy
>
> or a pizza delivery guy,
>
> or a snake charmer or something.
>
> I don't know.
>
> Instead, I have spent my whole life
>
> working with computers.
>
> I've been working with entirely the wrong hardware
>
> all these years.
>
> Okay, a weak reaction to that.
>
> I'd expected more.
>
> Can I call it a new joke?
>
> - Yeah, sure.
>
> - I heard something recently, I read something,
>
> and this is real, it blew my mind.
>
> So some psychologists studying men,
>
> they figured out that men only reach
>
> emotional and mental maturity at the age of 43.
>
> That is crazy, I'm like a four-year-old.
>
> I think this lady here understands
>
> what I'm talking about.
>
> - It's a new joke.
>
> - I mean, actually, when you think about this,
>
> it just, I do, sir, I just want to say
>
> I love the lesbian haircut that you're wearing.
>
> I'm with you there.
>
> How old are you, sir?
>
> - I'm 42.
>
> - 42, okay, you're up there.
>
> So you're one year to go, you're gonna be there.
>
> You know, and sometimes when I see a young couple,
>
> like they're both 24, and I just think,
>
> okay, so women apparently reach maturity at 32.
>
> That's 11 years before men, 11 years.
>
> So when you see a couple that's 24,
>
> that's actually like a 13-year-old
>
> with someone that has a strange love of young boys.
>
> It is a very weird thing.
>
> It actually changes your whole perspective on anything,
>
> like weddings, for example.
>
> You have the bride and the groom.
>
> Is that 'cause she spent five years grooming him
>
> to come to this event?
>
> I don't know.
>
> Just a thought, okay.
>
> I read another thing recently.
>
> Let's move on from the idea
>
> that all women are pedophiles.
>
> 'Cause that is clearly making people uncomfortable.
>
> I read another thing.
>
> Let's make it a bit more uncomfortable for the guys,
>
> 'cause I read that they did a survey,
>
> and they discovered that in the age range 20 to 40,
>
> almost 50% of men sent a dick pic
>
> in the last three months.
>
> That is a crazy statistic.
>
> Maybe I can help you.
>
> Ma'am, can I use you for the purposes of this show
>
> to be sure? (audience laughing)
>
> I'm not gonna send you a dick pic.
>
> I just, what's your name, ma'am?
>
> - Stephanie. - Stephanie, so Stephanie.
>
> To help you visualize this number, Stephanie,
>
> if you gave your number to 10 guys in this room,
>
> by Christmas time, you got a stack of five dicks,
>
> and that's fantastic.
>
> You can then print them out,
>
> use them as Christmas cards,
>
> hang 'em from your tree,
>
> put 'em in an album, give it as a present to your dad.
>
> There's so much you can do with this.
>
> I see, Stephanie, you're still struggling with this.
>
> I'm just looking around.
>
> Who of these guys could be in that 50%?
>
> Obviously, you. (audience laughing)
>
> Dick.
>
> When you send us a selfie, just of your face,
>
> are you like, "Hey, I just sent you a dick pic."
>
> Do you do that sometimes?
>
> Have you ever done that?
>
> 'Cause it's a dick pic.
>
> I get it.
>
> You never made that connection.
>
> Okay, thank you.
>
> Please do that this evening after the show.
>
> I didn't believe it.
>
> What?
>
> - What's your number?
>
> - Wow, ah.
>
> This just turned into the greatest show I've ever done.
>
> Ah, thank you.
>
> Chris, I feel that you, you know,
>
> maybe you could support me in my comedy career
>
> in anything, right?
>
> - Yeah.
>
> - You could pay me on dick pics.
>
> Now, I don't take dick pics myself.
>
> Now, you may not believe that, you know,
>
> when you have a perfect penis,
>
> obviously you'd think you would,
>
> but the reason why I don't take dick pics myself
>
> is I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because taking a quality dick pic is hard.
>
> You know, there's a lot to think about.
>
> You gotta think about the lighting.
>
> Do you go for like a soft, mellow tone
>
> to bring out the skin colors
>
> or something more red and erotic?
>
> Do I need some props, you know?
>
> Do I need to put some roses around here
>
> for this dick pic?
>
> I don't wanna prick my dick as I'm doing this.
>
> And, you know, you also gotta think about the angle
>
> 'cause it's a selfie.
>
> Is it like here or here?
>
> Or like under there?
>
> I don't know.
>
> Luckily for you guys, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> That's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> Okay, I think, but I'm not gonna give it to you guys
>
> 'cause I don't feel that you appreciate
>
> the genius of that invention enough this evening.
>
> - Give it to us.
>
> - I'll give it to you for free,
>
> a free sample for you, sir.
>
> Okay, so, you know, sometimes when I think about
>
> all the dick pics that I'm not able to take
>
> because I'm a perfectionist, I get very depressed.
>
> And when that happens, I do what a real man does.
>
> I get on YouTube and watch animal videos.
>
> And recently, I discovered an animal.
>
> This creature blew my mind.
>
> This is the greatest sea creature in all the oceans.
>
> Dick, can you guess what animal I'm talking about?
>
> - A mantis shrimp.
>
> - A what?
>
> - What?
>
> - No, that was the last joke again
>
> that you just reacted to.
>
> Dick, dick, tell me, greatest sea creature.
>
> She's just throwing me off.
>
> - A shark.
>
> - A shark, a shark is a very good choice, but wrong.
>
> - Whale.
>
> - The great, no, not whale, you only get one guess,
>
> people, fuck it up, but you're all wrong.
>
> The greatest animal in all the oceans,
>
> not a dolphin either, Sasha.
>
> It is the?
>
> - A sheep.
>
> - A sheep.
>
> - In the ocean.
>
> - Did you, what did you do to the sheep
>
> after it ended up in the ocean?
>
> - A shrimp.
>
> - A shrimp, oh, a shrimp.
>
> No, do we have any, okay.
>
> - Your mother's swimming.
>
> - No, that's not right, let's work this out now.
>
> You don't want the joke, come on, give me more sea creatures,
>
> let's get it out of your system.
>
> - Plankton.
>
> - What, plankton?
>
> You call a plankton a great sea creature.
>
> Now I understand what's happening in this relationship.
>
> Anyone else, any more sea creatures?
>
> Oh, can I tell my joke now?
>
> All right.
>
> - A sea sheep.
>
> - A what?
>
> - A sea sheep.
>
> - A sea sheep.
>
> - You didn't think of sheep on Earth, right?
>
> - Dick, I think you need to focus on your dick, Dick.
>
> So, it's true, oh, do you have an animal?
>
> - An octopus.
>
> - An octopus.
>
> - Thank you, ma'am, one person, give it up for her.
>
> What is your name, ma'am?
>
> - Deanna.
>
> - Deanna, Deanna, I don't know what your price is,
>
> but you deserve a prize after showing up
>
> the entire audience here tonight.
>
> The greatest, exactly, it's an octopus,
>
> but it's a very special type of octopus,
>
> it's called the argonaut octopus.
>
> Now I need to explain this to you,
>
> I know that's gonna be tough for the IQ level here,
>
> so pay close attention.
>
> Oh, this crowd is getting upset now,
>
> I insulted their intelligence.
>
> No, you're all great people,
>
> you're very imaginative with your sea creatures.
>
> All right, so, argonaut octopus.
>
> Now to explain this, the female argonaut is very aggressive,
>
> and so the male, if he gets anywhere near the female,
>
> she's gonna eat him,
>
> so the men are terrified of the females,
>
> and I'm sensing there could be a few of these two guys,
>
> especially here, understand this octopus.
>
> So, the male has developed a unique solution,
>
> I need to explain this in my David Attenborough voice.
>
> When the male of a species spots a female,
>
> he detaches his penis, it swims through the water,
>
> and it hones in on her vagina.
>
> Oh, sorry, not your vagina, that was accidental.
>
> Yeah, shit, you know, Google this stuff,
>
> there is an octopus out there, I'll put it in layman's terms,
>
> it has a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> This is the greatest,
>
> why are we not teaching kids in school about this?
>
> It is insanely brilliant.
>
> And what it made me realize, it just got me thinking,
>
> I was like, wow, why is it only octopuses?
>
> What if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be crazy, that would be insane.
>
> We probably have, like, dick-related sports, you know?
>
> You'd have, like, dick racing,
>
> you'd have, like, the dickathlon,
>
> Nike changes its slogan to just dick it,
>
> and you'd have a whole new set of dick-related problems,
>
> like, what if you lost your dick?
>
> My God, that would be insane,
>
> you just gotta hope you don't have on your phone,
>
> like, find my penis.
>
> - Dick insurance.
>
> - Dick insurance, good, but do you work in insurance?
>
> He's immediately spotted an opportunity.
>
> Very, I like the entrepreneurial level here.
>
> Could you borrow your friend's dick?
>
> You know, he'd be like,
>
> I wasn't cheating, it was his dick.
>
> Yeah, I don't know, it's a lot of things.
>
> And the more I thought about it, the more crazy it gets,
>
> and, you know, Stephanie was like,
>
> can I use you again for another example joke?
>
> What would you do as a professional, Stephanie?
>
> - Event coordinator.
>
> - You, I'm sorry?
>
> - Event coordinator.
>
> - Event coordinator, very nice.
>
> So imagine, it's Monday morning,
>
> you've got Stephanie, she's at the tram stop,
>
> she's on her phone just trying to,
>
> in the calendar, coordinating events,
>
> and she's, like, just kind of oblivious
>
> to the world around her, and suddenly, bam!
>
> This dick just slaps her in the face!
>
> She's like, oh, fuck!
>
> She hides behind some old lady just to throw it off,
>
> she gets down, she pulls out her dick shield
>
> like Captain America, dicks are just flying all around,
>
> hitting the shield, boom, boom, boom.
>
> She's like, oh, fuck, the tram arrives,
>
> she jumps in, she arrives at work,
>
> and luckily, there's a sign saying,
>
> please keep your penis attached during office hours.
>
> Moral of the story, would you like a moral
>
> just to wrap this up?
>
> So the moral is that even though we live
>
> in these strange times of COVID and Donald Trump
>
> and environmental meltdown, look on the bright side.
>
> At least you're not being chased down the street
>
> by a flying penis.
>
> All right, it's a happy ending for the show.
>
> Thanks a lot, guys.
>
> Okay, well, this was a great show.
