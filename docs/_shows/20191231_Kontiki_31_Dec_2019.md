<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> I'll take it. No, no, I like what you have going for it. I'll take it. Ladies and gentlemen,
>
> welcome to the stage, your next act, Mr. Harry Fux!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> If I'm in a room with English speakers, I guess a lot of you think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them "how the" and "what the" just to give them a good start in
>
> life.
>
> But you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fux is that it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> There's really only been about this much fucking, but honestly it was that much fucking.
>
> And in fact, recently, it has in fact been a long time since I've had any sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> David? No? OK. David's getting it too. Wow.
>
> I hadn't realized I was coming to the Zurich Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meeting.
>
> So maybe to help you guys understand my condition a bit, how it is when you haven't had sex in a
>
> long time.
>
> It's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street, and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's
>
> asses.
>
> And you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, and you spot an "Action" on watermelon. You get one hand on that watermelon,
>
> maybe two.
>
> Bam! It's like you're in a new dimension. It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot, it's getting steamy, you don't care who's watching.
>
> And then suddenly you hear this, "Junge, man, schämen Sie sich!"
>
> And there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you look at her and think, "She's nice."
>
> Thank you. One applause there. I appreciate one applause.
>
> Let's keep it to just one applause for tonight.
>
> It's been a tough year for me, 2019, because I got dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> Thank you, I appreciate that.
>
> But on the plus side, it has made me an expert on all Swiss women.
>
> And I think I can give you some good tips.
>
> And I learned some things about Swiss women, because they have certain key phrases that they use.
>
> Like, "Oh, schätzli!"
>
> That is a great thing, because that means there's a high probability of sexual favors.
>
> But if Sandra says to you, "Shut up!"
>
> That is bad news, you should probably spend the night on the sofa.
>
> But if she says to you, "Purkehle!"
>
> That's a good thing. That means she's as horny as a whore.
>
> But if she says, "Leck mich doch am Arsch!"
>
> Now, this one's very confusing.
>
> Because there's under no circumstances should you try to lick her asshole.
>
> Unless she says, "Das ist ein Schießdreck!"
>
> In which case, you could try to lick her asshole.
>
> But you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> I feel like we've set this relationship up for a wonderful future.
>
> It's going to be a fantastic thing.
>
> Yeah, I don't know. So, you know, 2018.
>
> I just got back. Actually, I just got back from Germany.
>
> I had to spend Germany at my mum's place.
>
> For me, as a guy in my 40s, spending time at my mum's house is just awful.
>
> It's just like, I don't even get to jack off in private.
>
> It's like, I had to use the kitchen.
>
> It's just horrible.
>
> But, you know, she's 82, so I'm not going to have to do this shit much longer.
>
> But thinking about 2019, it has been a crazy year.
>
> And I read something even crazier this morning.
>
> That apparently 2019, believe it or not, was the best year in human history.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> Because, you know, like, poverty is down.
>
> Infant mortality is down.
>
> Literacy is up.
>
> And it got me thinking, like, so why are we all so miserable?
>
> Why are we all so miserable?
>
> And then it hit me.
>
> It hit me.
>
> The answer is, we're not Jewish.
>
> Because if you're Jewish, you don't need to be told that this is a great year.
>
> Because, you know, like, 80 years ago, that was a bad year for Jews.
>
> I think my German colleagues, who are very quiet right now, know what I'm talking about.
>
> But, you know, now, a Jew is a very happy person.
>
> If you want to be happy in 2020, convert to Judaism.
>
> That's my tip.
>
> Okay, I'm sorry.
>
> This joke was too Jew-y.
>
> Okay, we'll try to stay away from that.
>
> So, let's go somewhere else, you know.
>
> I'm thinking about, you know, it's like New Year's Resolution time.
>
> Anyone here got their New Year's Resolutions ready?
>
> You know, even New Year's Resolutions.
>
> These are like the things you're going to give up in 2020.
>
> Anyone been working on this stuff?
>
> Because, you know, I've been working on my...
>
> I was thinking, like, what can I stop in 2020?
>
> I thought, what about porn?
>
> I mean, obviously not all the porn.
>
> That would be just too much.
>
> But maybe just a few categories, you know.
>
> Maybe I could just give up on a few categories of porn.
>
> Like MILFs, for example.
>
> MILFs.
>
> Mothers I'd like to fuck.
>
> Because I'm a father.
>
> I have kids, you know.
>
> I have a lot of access to mothers.
>
> Probably I'm not going to get to fuck them.
>
> But it's the chances there I could probably afford to give that up.
>
> Or, you know, or maybe GILFs.
>
> You heard of GILFs?
>
> This is even worse.
>
> This is grannies I'd like to fuck.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> I don't want to fuck any grannies.
>
> Jesus.
>
> I mean, you know, I've got to save something to look forward to when I get older.
>
> So I think we could skip on that.
>
> You know, another one maybe that I'd probably skip would be tentacle porn.
>
> Anyone into the tentacle porn here that is insane enough to admit that?
>
> No, you see, I just don't think we should be doing that kind of stuff to sea life.
>
> You know, that's just not okay.
>
> Sea life belongs in the sea, not in the pussy.
>
> Okay, we've gone too dark.
>
> Too dark.
>
> I'm sorry, people.
>
> But that's how I feel at the end of 2019.
>
> David, tell me, are you giving up any porn categories?
>
> Never.
>
> Never?
>
> That is a fantastic German answer.
>
> I'm going to conquer all the porn in 2020.
>
> Anyone else thinking of giving up any porn?
>
> This guy looks like he needs to give up some porn.
>
> What's your name, sir?
>
> I'm Anton.
>
> Anton.
>
> Anton, what porn--if you had to give up some porn, what porn would you give up, Anton?
>
> The hard one.
>
> The hard one, yes.
>
> The hard porn, yes.
>
> But which--you can't choose.
>
> Okay, you're on a desert island.
>
> You can't take all your porn with you.
>
> Which one would you leave behind?
>
> This is such a tough decision.
>
> Wow.
>
> Anton, I appreciate that you love porn so much that it's just so hard to figure out what to abandon.
>
> Just what's the first category that comes to your mind?
>
> Threesome.
>
> Threesome porn.
>
> Yeah, you're on a desert island.
>
> It's just you.
>
> That's a great decision.
>
> You're not getting any threesomes ever again.
>
> This is a smart man right now.
>
> Anton, well done.
>
> Good choice for 2020.
>
> All right, I don't know where I'm going with this.
>
> Can you pass my drink over there?
>
> Which one's which?
>
> That one, yeah.
>
> That?
>
> I just need a sip of this stuff.
>
> You know, do you know this stuff?
>
> Do you guys drink this stuff, Vitamin Well?
>
> You know these things?
>
> They've got them all over--you know, these things.
>
> You see that?
>
> They've got them in all the kiosks now in Zurich, you know, Vitamin Well.
>
> And I just can't stop drinking this shit because, you know, it's just like a bottle.
>
> A bottle that's full of bullshit wrapped in some marketing with a word on it, like "reload."
>
> I am reloaded right now.
>
> Holy shit.
>
> I just believe the words they put on this stuff, you know.
>
> They have other words like "upgrade" and "defense" and "antioxidant."
>
> I get really excited about it.
>
> I'm like, what other words could they have?
>
> Like, they could have "huge," you know.
>
> We could get some big dick energy off that.
>
> Or maybe "cliver" so I can be smart enough to stop drinking this shit.
>
> Or maybe just "funny."
>
> I could be the greatest comedian in the world.
>
> All right, you guys need a bottle of laugh right now.
>
> Wow.
>
> Okay, so let me just end this.
>
> Should I go on this track?
>
> Let's keep on going.
>
> One more thing.
>
> So, you know, I told you already, I'm a father.
>
> I have two teenage kids.
>
> And, you know, and I'm a single dad.
>
> They live with me.
>
> I do the whole thing on my own, you know.
>
> And, for example, like, with my daughter, yeah, having a teenage daughter,
>
> I'm constantly having to deal with stuff that I'm completely unprepared for.
>
> Because recently I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom, and oh my God, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror, drops of blood in the sink,
>
> more blood on the floor, and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard this screaming, and I looked around.
>
> And I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter turned up and said, "Hey, Dad, I got my period."
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood, I was like, "Can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, obviously, as a man, I have zero qualifications for this job.
>
> But I thought, it can't be so hard.
>
> So I went back into Migros, this time wearing a wig.
>
> And I took a look around, and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like OB Pro.
>
> And what is this, like for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> Damn, I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance, like glow-in-the-dark tampons,
>
> so when the lights are off, you can't find the way in.
>
> Or Always Infinity. I really like this one.
>
> It's like for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing a different product from Always.
>
> It's fantastic. It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> Wow. Because around about 10 o'clock, it starts to leak,
>
> and she is always home by eleven.
>
> It was wonderful. And for me, this whole experience was a very proud one as a father.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> Wow. We've ended 2019 on the lowest point. I love it.
>
> So you guys have a fantastic New Year.
>
> Build yourselves back up for me.
>
> This will be the thing that you can just forget about 2019 from this point on.
>
> All right, Chris. Give me a second.
