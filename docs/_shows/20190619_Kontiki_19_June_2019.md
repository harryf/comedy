> Give it up once again for Gregorio.
>
> Okay, folks, we only have one last comedian left here in our first half, I know.
>
> Aww.
>
> Do it harder!
>
> Aww.
>
> Okay, that's nice. That feels good now.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we only have one last comedian left, and we're going to
>
> take a very quick break
>
> and try to clean up this fucking curtain behind me.
>
> So, without further ado, give him a big round of applause, Harry Fuchs,
>
> everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name
>
> is Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them "Halber" and "Walper."
>
> I needed to give them a good start when I was there.
>
> Yeah, but, you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is it sets a
>
> very high level of expectation.
>
> I've only really done it like this much, I think.
>
> And, you know, this is actually, I'm going to just confess to something.
>
> It's actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> We don't want it to, but, you know, the rest of us, they seem to be desiring nymphomaniacs.
>
> Well, maybe for you guys, I'll just kind of explain a little bit the condition
>
> that a few of us have here.
>
> See, when you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street and you see a couple of dogs.
>
> And they're like sniffing each other's asses. And you're looking at them and
>
> you're thinking, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros. You go into Migros and you spot an action on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Cut. You're in a different dimension.
>
> It's getting steamy. You're at Migros. You've forgotten that people are
>
> watching you.
>
> And suddenly you hear, "Junge Mann, schämen Sie sich nicht."
>
> And you look and there's an old lady in the back, maybe with her handbag.
>
> And you think, "Oh, she's nice."
>
> I mean, actually, though, you know, I've had a lot of experience with
>
> relationships.
>
> And, you know, the last 20 years or so I was in one long-term relationship or
>
> another.
>
> Last year now, I've been back in the dating pool, which obviously sucks.
>
> But luckily, like 20 years ago, we didn't have Tinder.
>
> And as we've already heard about Tinder tonight, I thought, "Okay, maybe give
>
> Tinder a try."
>
> Maybe Tinder is the answer. How wrong I was.
>
> Because let me explain. For you guys, you're mostly pretty young.
>
> So Tinder under 30 is an amazing place.
>
> You get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies and potential erotic
>
> encounters.
>
> And the idea that your prince, your dream man, might somewhere be in here.
>
> But for me, for me, Tinder over 40 is a dark place.
>
> I have to swipe my way through broken marriages,
>
> drug and alcohol problems, faded tattoos saying, "No regrets."
>
> It's brutal. It's brutal.
>
> And it actually makes me wonder, "Ladies, what is it that happens in the next
>
> 10 to 15 years
>
> that leads to most of your lives being ruined?"
>
> Was it that prince you found on Tinder?
>
> Because, you know, it's interesting when you look at the profiles of older
>
> women,
>
> they're oddly specific about what they don't want in the next relationship.
>
> It's kind of like this is what their prince did to them.
>
> Like, "Swipe left if you hate children."
>
> "Swipe left if you want to run off with my sister."
>
> "Swipe left if you fantasize about adult diapers."
>
> You know, it's really specific, but it's pretty dark.
>
> But actually, the worst thing about older Tinder for me, the most terrifying
>
> thing,
>
> is the sight of a 50-year-old woman making a duck face.
>
> I mean, how the fuck do you get to 50 years thinking a duck face is okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is ever okay is if both your parents are ducks.
>
> And actually, ducks only live about 10 years.
>
> The universe did not intend a 50-year-old duck face ever.
>
> Yeah, it's strange, though.
>
> But actually, one woman, she was 52.
>
> She texted me, and she was like, "With those cute blue eyes,
>
> how is it you're still running around free?"
>
> Now, aside from that being the worst chat-up line I think I've ever heard,
>
> can you imagine if I said that to any woman?
>
> "You shouldn't be running around free!"
>
> "You should be tied up in my dungeon!"
>
> It made me realize that basically the problem here is that older women,
>
> they don't really know how to chat up men.
>
> They have zero game.
>
> Because for all these years, men have been chasing them.
>
> Men have been getting all the practice in how to chat them up.
>
> But now, things are getting a bit saggy.
>
> Men are not as interested as they used to be.
>
> And I feel kind of sorry for them, because I actually read as well
>
> that as women get older, their sex drive actually increases.
>
> So what we're saying here is that they have zero game,
>
> they're super horny, and no one really wants to fuck them.
>
> We need to find a solution to this problem.
>
> We need a solution.
>
> Surely there's some other group that has zero game, is super horny,
>
> and no one wants to fuck.
>
> Teenage boys.
>
> And then after all the women, it's called "teen-dar".
>
> It's a funny thing.
>
> But recently, actually I was walking down Badenerstrasse,
>
> like over there in the cool part of Zurich where the hipsters live,
>
> and this young man came past on his bicycle, on his hipster bicycle,
>
> and he looked me in the eye and did this.
>
> Now, at first I was quite impressed,
>
> because he was right next to the tram track.
>
> He pulled that off without wiping out.
>
> But then I thought, "Wait a second.
>
> This young man is actually onto something."
>
> Because I am a first-class masturbator.
>
> My hand and my penis is a love affair of over 40 years,
>
> longer than most of you have even been on the planet.
>
> And it's got to the point where I just think about my hand,
>
> and if I go on a date with a woman,
>
> and I'm like, "Wow, she's kind of cute, yeah, but could she be my hand?"
>
> Because my hand doesn't need a back rub.
>
> My hand doesn't want to go on a date.
>
> It does not want to have babies one day.
>
> When I look at it, my hand is kind of perfect.
>
> So I'm going to end here by asking you guys to give my hand a big hand,
>
> and I'm going to say goodnight, and maybe shake some hands.
>
> Give it up once again for Harry Fox, first-class masturbator.
