>
> F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room of English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is
>
> Harry Fox. My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset.
>
> When you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them how-the and what-the just to give them
>
> a good start on life.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is there just hasn't been
>
> enough fucking.
>
> In fact, this whole lockdown situation, if I can share something with you guys,
>
> it has actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Well, obviously not Ricardo, he's like getting it proud, but Simona, I'm very
>
> upset that you came over here and I've just been sleeping around with your

>
> No, okay, so, if I can explain my condition to you, how it is when you haven't
>
> had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street and you see a couple of dogs sniffing
>
> each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and think...
>
> I wish that wasn't me.
>
> Or you go into a micro, you go into a micro, you spot an axion on a watermelon,
>
> you get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two, bam, it's like you're in a new
>
> dimension, it's just you and that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting
>
> steamy, you're oblivious to all the people watching, and then you hear this
>
> voice saying, you're my man's shaman's, he's like, can you look?
>
> And there's an old lady about.
>
> And there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag, and you think, she's
>
> nice.
>
> Yeah, so that's how that was.
>
> But, yeah, so locked up, feeling very horny, and my stupid brain gave me a
>
> really stupid idea.
>
> I got on Tinder.
>
> Now, for you guys, you're mostly pretty young, you know, like, for you guys,
>
> Tinder is an amazing place.
>
> Because you get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies.
>
> And potential erotic encounters.
>
> And the dream that your prince, your perfect match, could somehow be in here.
>
> But for me, I have to deal with all the Tinder.
>
> And all the Tinder is a dark place.
>
> Because I have to swipe my way through broken marriages, drug and alcohol
>
> problems, faded tattoos saying, no, I'm not going to do that.
>
