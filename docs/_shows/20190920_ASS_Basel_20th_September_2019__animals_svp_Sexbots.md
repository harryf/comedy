> Give it up for Chef Cuff, everybody.
>
> She's adorable and great.
>
> Very nice. Holy amnesia.
>
> Okay, folks, we've only got one last
>
> act left in our first half, and oh my god, you're going to like this guy.
>
> He's only been here, I believe, once before, but he is definitely
>
> a part of our comedy scene over there in Zurich. He's very funny. Ladies and
>
> gentlemen,
>
> he's originally from the UK, but he's been living here in Switzerland for over
>
> 17 years. He's very funny, ladies and gentlemen, and this is
>
> his real name. Give it up, everybody, for Harry
>
> Fuchs! Give it up, please!
>
> So my name is actually Harry
>
> Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name. It's spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S. The teachers here
>
> know the importance of accuracy.
>
> But unfortunately, when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of
>
> you think my name is Harry
>
> Fuchs. My name is not
>
> Harry Fuchs. And in my family, when we have a family
>
> get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. And I had to call them Howler
>
> and Whatler. Just to give them a chance
>
> anyway. But you see, the real problem with a name like this
>
> is I get a lot of stupid comments. Like recently, this American tourist,
>
> he came up to me and he said, "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fuchs!
>
> Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I said, "Yeah, Harry Fuchs what?"
>
> So I thought, alright, I can throw him off with some adverbs here.
>
> Like, uh, Harry Fuchs hopefully.
>
> Harry Fuchs occasionally.
>
> Harry Fuchs enthusiastically.
>
> But he was like, "No, man, no. Harry Fuchs
>
> goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens. Harry Fuchs tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that
>
> in the entire history of mankind, no one has ever successfully
>
> fucked a tiger. And what it made me
>
> realize is that there is actually a whole category of
>
> unfuckable animals. Like, take hippos,
>
> for example. Now, you may get up behind a hippo and think, "Mmm,
>
> that's a sweet ass." Don't do it.
>
> Because hippos, they kill about 500 people every year. They're the most
>
> dangerous
>
> land animal. Don't fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants. Elephants, for example, because it's just too high up.
>
> You just can't really reach. But maybe if the moms
>
> aren't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Alright, okay, I'm just finding your level.
>
> What I see is you're okay with
>
> sexuality, but not pedophiles.
>
> I'll try to pull it back a bit.
>
> Let's change the topic.
>
> As I said, I'm originally from England. I've been here a long
>
> time, and I'm actually in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> And when I get my passport, I'm going to be voting
>
> SRP. Because it is
>
> time to do something about all the immigrants.
>
> And specifically, I mean the English
>
> speaking immigrants. Like Steve the writer.
>
> The American writer, you know. Because let's take a look at these
>
> guys, you know. They voted for Brexit. They voted for Trump.
>
> And then they were like, "Oh my god, we fucked up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> This round of applause here is...
>
> Steve, there's definitely something going on there. Because, you know,
>
> you've got to ask, when they get here, what are they actually contributing to
>
> society?
>
> Because, you know, like when the Indians and the Vietnamese came here, they
>
> brought
>
> with them great cuisine. Or the Brazilians and the
>
> Romanians, when they came here, they brought sexual relief.
>
> These English speakers are just going out in the evening
>
> and listening to stand-up comedy
>
> in English.
>
> It's just not okay.
>
> But I know, it's kind of
>
> fucked up to think about this stuff.
>
> And I think, for me personally,
>
> you know, I have a lot of these dark thoughts
>
> and I think actually it goes
>
> back to my childhood. Because
>
> I went to a Catholic
>
> school.
>
> But I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> But I...
>
> One thing to realize, living here, is
>
> that I am actually not the most fucked up
>
> person in this country. Actually,
>
> the most fucked up people
>
> in this country, do you know who that is?
>
> PhD students.
>
> Dominic
>
> and Gio Moglia.
>
> But just take a look, take a look,
>
> you know, imagine Dominic.
>
> It's three in the morning. He's been working
>
> on his dissertation all day and
>
> into the night. And he's got a
>
> head full of, like, statistical models
>
> and equations and
>
> epidemiology, whatever that thing is.
>
> How is he gonna switch off and go to
>
> bed?
>
> Alt-Tab, oops. Pornhub.
>
> I'm sorry to tell
>
> you this, Sarah, but when he says,
>
> "Honey, I'll be coming to bed later."
>
> Maybe you should go and have a look.
>
> Because
>
> the average PhD takes
>
> about eight years to complete.
>
> Do you know how fucked up it gets after
>
> eight years of this? We're not talking
>
> good wholesome porn hair anymore.
>
> We are deep into BDSM
>
> and gang names and
>
> proletarbonics and dwarfs or any other
>
> hoes.
>
> As long as it's available for babies.
>
> Yeah, okay, we'll stay away from the
>
> adult babies.
>
> This guy is
>
> on point. This is right. He's got a
>
> PhD.
>
> But, you know, I thought about this. I thought,
>
> you know, maybe there's some kind of
>
> solution. Because at some point, like,
>
> these PhD students are going to get their
>
> dream job at a place like Google.
>
> And then Google is going to stuff them in an
>
> office full of ten other horny
>
> PhDs.
>
> Now, you may have heard that
>
> last year, 30,000
>
> Google employees walked
>
> out to protest sexual harassment.
>
> Of course, because of all
>
> their PhD students.
>
> Fuck. They were like, "We've got to get the
>
> fuck out of here." But,
>
> I've realized that there is a technological
>
> solution to this problem. And this
>
> is one I think you're going to appreciate, Steve.
>
> The solution is
>
> Sexbots.
>
> Because just
>
> imagine, just imagine that Google
>
> announces, you know, "We
>
> rolled out Sexbots to all our
>
> staff in cases of sexual
>
> harassment have dropped an amazing
>
> 84%.
>
> We use Sexbot analytics
>
> to track staff performance.
>
> Since we rolled
>
> out Sexbots, our staff are more
>
> focused and productive."
>
> I think what's clear is that
>
> Sexbots are going to go mainstream.
>
> And then when that happens, the big guys,
>
> the big tech companies are going to be like,
>
> "Wow, this is a billion dollar market."
>
> And then you're going to have Apple like,
>
> "We brought you the iPod. We brought
>
> you the iPhone. Today,
>
> we bring you the
>
> iFuck."
>
> And then Google's going to be like, "Shit, man. Apple's
>
> moving fast. Quick. Launch the
>
> Google Ho."
>
> And then Amazon's going to
>
> be like, "Oh, my God. Quick. Take a
>
> Alexa. Take drones. We call it
>
> the flying fuck."
>
> But as always is the way with
>
> technology, every time technology solves
>
> problems, it brings me problems.
>
> Because, you know, just imagine
>
> you invite some of your bros round for
>
> beer and, you know, it gets
>
> late. And then next morning you go to text your
>
> buddy like, "Hey, man.
>
> Last night, did you
>
> sleep with my Sexbot?"
>
> And he's like, "Oh, I'm sorry,
>
> man. I was drunk. She came on to me."
>
> And then you're
>
> going to be like, "Dude, fuck, man. You didn't
>
> even wash her out."
>
> Yeah, I know. It's dark. We need
>
> a solution for this, too. I think
>
> that we need Sexbot security.
>
> Swipe
>
> your date to get in.
>
> Steve, feel free to put
>
> that in your next post.
>
> All right. Thank
>
> you. I think it's time for me to go.
>
> Hey, give it up! Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Thank you.
