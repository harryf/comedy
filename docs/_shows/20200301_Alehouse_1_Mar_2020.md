> British, but he's been living here in Switzerland for more than 17 years.
>
> And this guy is hilarious. And yes, this is his real name. Everybody give it up.
>
> It's Harry Fuchs. Give it up for Harry Fuchs.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name. It's spelled F-U. C-K-S-R-O-P-F-U.
>
> C-K-S. But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fuchs. My name is not Harry Fuchs. And in my family, when we have a family get
>
> together, we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Hal the and Watt the.
>
> I've got to give them a good starting line. But the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is
>
> I get a lot of stupid comments. Like recently, this guy came up to me. It's American tourists.
>
> He's like, "Yo, Harry Fuchs. Harry Fuchs Watt, man." I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "Exactly.
>
> Harry Fuchs Watt, man." I'm like, "All right. Let me see if I can throw him off with some adverbs.
>
> Harry Fuchs hopefully. Harry Fuchs occasionally. Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> And that's where I threw him off. He was just confused. So was I. A lot of confusion.
>
> But actually, before I continue, I do have to make one thing clear. I identify
>
> as an attractive woman. I'm not gay. I just identify as an attractive woman for the benefits.
>
> I'll be at the bar after the show if you want to buy my drink.
>
> Maybe Rick here can relate to this. He might be an attractive woman too,
>
> but please don't buy him any drinks at the bar. That wouldn't be okay.
>
> There are a lot of benefits to being an attractive woman. I went into Starbucks
>
> and I ordered a green tea frappe. And the guy said, "What's your name?" And I said,
>
> "My name is Harry. I'm an attractive woman." And he said, "Hey, well then this drink's on the house."
>
> And I said, "Thank you. Please bring it to my table."
>
> Or, you know, recently I was driving. I was a little bit over the limit and
>
> the police stopped me and they said, "We're going to need some identity."
>
> And I said, "My identity is attractive woman." And they said, "Well then, hey, you're free to go."
>
> After you've blown into this.
>
> Okay, I should, I'm sorry. I didn't write these jokes. Some guy wrote them for me.
>
> So a lot of people at the moment are worried about coronavirus. Anyone worried about coronavirus
>
> here? Apparently this guy in the corner, some skeptic over there. I was a bit worried. I
>
> got myself tested. The good news is that I don't have coronavirus. The bad news is some of you
>
> have A's. Okay, those two. I'm an attractive woman. Just don't even, don't even, I don't care.
>
> But you should get tested. Yeah, I don't know. How's your, how's your 2020 been going so far?
>
> You've been enjoying 2020? Having a good time? Yeah, fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. That was a lame
>
> "fuck yeah" from over there. Yeah, and well, I've been having a bit of a shitty 2020 because,
>
> you know, I've been feeling a bit kind of down and depressed, all this dark weather.
>
> And so I did what a real man does under these circumstances. I go on YouTube and I watch
>
> animal videos. And then I found an animal that just totally cheered me up. This animal is so
>
> incredible that, you know, I'm amazed I got to this age and not knowing about this. So let me
>
> explain. I got to explain a little bit. So the animal I'm talking about is called the argonaut
>
> octopus. Okay. And so the female argonaut is extremely aggressive, you know, and if the male
>
> gets anywhere near, she's going to eat it. So the men are terrified of the females. I think there's
>
> a few guys in that corner who can relate to this. But so what the males have done, they've
>
> developed
>
> a unique solution to this. This is incredible. And I put on my David Attenborough voice to explain
>
> this. So when the male of the species spots a female, he detaches his penis, the penis swims
>
> through the sea, and homes in on her vagina. Sorry, not your vagina. And there's a mum here
>
> just going, "Why? My whole family is here. Just getting ruined." And I'm like, "Gareth,
>
> you're responsible for this." Yeah, no, so this is actually true. This animal exists. There is a,
>
> so I'll put it in layman's terms. There is an octopus out there with a detachable,
>
> heat-seeking dick. This thing is incredible. And why are we not teaching kids in school about this?
>
> And I got thinking, like, wow, how crazy would it be if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be insane. Like, everything would be different, you know? Like, you know,
>
> imagine it's like, it's like Monday morning and Natko here, you know, she's just hanging around
>
> in Stadelhoff and she's got some rubber duck, you know, thinking about the farmer job today.
>
> Suddenly, bam! This dick just slaps her in the face. She's like, "Oh, fuck!" She hides behind
>
> some old ladies. She holds up the rubber duck. Dicks are just flying everywhere, bouncing off
>
> the duck. She jumps in the train. She arrives at her farmer company. Luckily, there's a sign
>
> saying, "Please keep your penis attached." It would be insane. I mean, a world... And the more
>
> I thought about it, like, the crazier the world would be. There's some people just losing it.
>
> It would be insane how crazy the world... We probably have, like, dick-related sports,
>
> you know? You have, like, dick racing. Or at the Olympics, you've got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike changes its slogan to, "Just dick it." You know, that'd be crazy. And, you know, I mean,
>
> there's just so many questions. It actually raises more questions than what would happen
>
> if we had universal basic income. Because, you know, like, for example, what would happen
>
> if you lost your dick? That would be crazy. You just gotta hope you got an app on your phone,
>
> like, "Find my penis." Or could you borrow your friend's dick? That would be crazy. I wasn't
>
> cheating. It was his dick. So many possibilities. And then I thought about it more. I thought,
>
> "But what if when you shoot your dick, it's a one-time-only thing, and then you have to wait
>
> three months for your dick to regrow?" There's a lot of tension. Some of the ladies are like,
>
> "Well, that would be awful." But some others are like, "Oh, that would be such a relief.
>
> Finally." But, you know, and, you know, that would lead to more crazy stuff. You know, like,
>
> you know, when girls go to brunch on Sunday all happy, they're like, "Oh, last night,
>
> you know, it was so romantic. He got down on one knee and gave me his dick."
>
> That would be a romantic scene. Or couples, you know, when you ask them, like, "How long have you
>
> guys been together?" They wouldn't be like, "Nine years." Like, Thomas here would be like,
>
> "I think it was about 36 dicks." And Samantha would be like, "I remember 45."
>
> He's like, "Hanging around in Stratheaven too much, I guess."
>
> All right, I'm done. I'll leave you with the dick-pocalypse. You guys have a lot of fun.
>
> Okay, that was Harry "The Dick Philosopher" Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
