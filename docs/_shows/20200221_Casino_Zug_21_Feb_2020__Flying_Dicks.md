<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> This next guy, this is his first time here in two, and I think you guys are
>
> going to love him, okay?
>
> He's British, but he's been living in Zurich, in Switzerland, here for the past
>
> 18 years, okay?
>
> And yes, this is his real name. Everybody give it up, it's Harry Fox! Give it
>
> up for Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox. It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S, I
>
> repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Boy, I'm in a room of English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is
>
> Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family...
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group of fuckers!
>
> And I have two kids! I had to call them how-the and what-the, just to give them
>
> a fair starting line.
>
> But you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very
>
> high level of expectation.
>
> And honestly, there's only already been about this, to be honest.
>
> It's been a long time since I've had sex, but if I can share something with you
>
> guys here in the soup, honestly, it's been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time?
>
> Wow. Like food scientists, you're going on dates with your sister?
>
> Okay, sorry, sorry, it's not a question anymore.
>
> All right, so then I hadn't realized I was coming to the soup and nymphomaniacs
>
> are not on the list.
>
> So maybe I need to explain my condition to you guys a little bit, because when
>
> you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing
>
> each other's asses, and you look at them and you think, of course that was me.
>
> Or you go into a micro, you go into a micro, you spot an acción on board.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two, bang, it's like you're in a new
>
> dimension, it's just you and that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting
>
> steamy, you're oblivious to the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this voice saying, "Yungerman Shin!" and you look, and there's
>
> an old lady about to hit you with a handbag, and you think, "She's nice."
>
> Yeah, so that's how that is.
>
> But, so how has 2020 been going for you guys?
>
> Yeah, so that's how that is.
>
> But, so how has 2020 been going for you guys?
>

>
> But, so how has 2020 been going for you guys?
>
> You've been having a good 2020 so far?
>
> Have you even been alive in 2020 so far?
>
> You enjoying 2020, yes?
>
> Wow, well good for you, because I've been having a shitty 2020, you know,
>
> because I've been feeling kind of depressed about all the sex I'm not getting.
>
> And so I did what a real man does in these circumstances, I go on YouTube and
>
> watch animal videos.
>

>
> But then I found an animal that blew my mind, this really cheered me up. Wow,
>
> this animal is incredible. Can you guess what animal I'm talking about?
>
> Okay, when was the last time you went to the zoo? Been a long time, okay.
>
> Alright, so let me tell you what animal I'm talking about here. It's the Argonaut
>
> octopus. This creature is incredible.
>
> Now, I need to explain this a little bit, because the female Argonauts are
>
> extremely aggressive.
>
> You know, if the man gets anywhere near them, the female's going to eat it.
>
> So the men are terrified of the females, sensing there could be a, like this
>
> guy could relate to that, perhaps.
>
> Then, you know, so what the males have done is they've developed a unique
>
> solution, you know.
>
> And I'm going to have to explain this in my David Attenborough voice.
>
> So, hold on a second. One second, you're not interrupting the show. I'm just
>
> going to make it awkward for you.
>
> So, hold on a second. One second, you're not interrupting the show. I'm just

>
> fantastic. Thank you. I'll take whatever whiskey I can get at this point. No,
>
> no, you don't
>
> have to have ice in whiskey. That's a fence. Well, I like the Scottish whiskey.
>
> All right,
>
> good. So that's my other problem, the alcohol problem. Now, let's get back to
>
> the albino
>
> octopus, right? So the males have developed a unique solution. If I do, you
>
> know David
>
> Attenborough? All right, so let me explain this. So when the male of the
>
> species spots
>
> a female, he detaches his penis. The penis swings through the water and homes
>
> in on her
>
> vagina. Oh, sorry, not your vagina. Sorry. Sorry. I kid you not, this is real.
>
> There
>
> is an octopus out there.
>
> Let me put it in layman's terms. This octopus has a detachable, heat-seeking
>
> dick. That
>
> is incredible. Why are we not teaching kids in school about this stuff? And
>
> this really
>
> cheered me up. And then I got thinking about it, like, wow, wouldn't it be
>
> amazing, wouldn't
>
> it be amazing if human beings had detachable dicks? That would be crazy. Like,
>
> just imagine,
>
> it's Monday morning, and Samira over there, you know, she's waiting for the...
>
> she's waiting for the bus, just thinking about all kinds of new ways she can do
>
> marketing
>
> about oil, like thinking about this stuff. And suddenly, like, bam, this dick
>
> just slaps
>
> her in the face. She's like, oh, fuck. She has to hide behind some old ladies.
>
> She pulls
>
> out her dick shield like Captain America. Dicks are just flying all around,
>
> hitting
>
> the shield. And then she jumps on the bus. She arrives at the oil company. And
>
> luckily,
>
> there's a sign saying, please keep your penis attached during your visit.
>
> But, like, detachable dicks would be crazy, you know? I mean, we probably have,
>
> like,
>
> dick-related sports. You know, you'd have, like, dick racing. At the Olympics,
>
> you got
>
> the dickathlon. Nike changes its slogan to just dick it. It's crazy. And the
>
> more I thought
>
> about this, the more I thought, this raises more questions than universal basic
>
> income.
>
> You know, like, can you imagine, like, what would happen if you lost your dick?
>
> Wow, that would be crazy. You'd have to hope you got an app on your phone, like,
>
> find my
>
> penis. Or could you borrow your friend's dick? You know, that would be strange.
>
> That would
>
> be like, I wasn't cheating. It was Alex's dick. Crazy. Or, you know, like,
>
> Roman. You
>
> know, he's been out. He's been heavy drinking. He wakes up in the morning.
>
> Thank you for
>
> the whiskey at this moment. That really helps the show. Wow.
>
> Roman. Roman has been out drinking whiskey, drinking hard. He wakes up in the
>
> morning.
>
> He finds his dick in the corner. And he's like, what the? Is that covered in
>
> crude oil?
>
> That is gross. Jesus. But then I got thinking, like, what if, what if when you
>
> shoot your
>
> dick, it's a one-time thing, and then you have to wait three months for your
>
> dick to
>
> regrow? Wow. Like, okay, there's some ladies here that'd be like, that would be
>
> fantastic.
>
> Finally a break from the non-stop. But, you know, young ladies, they'd be like,
>
> they'd
>
> go out to brunch together. They'd be like, oh, last night, it was so romantic.
>
> He got
>
> down on his knee, and he gave me his dick. It would be crazy. Or, you know,
>
> like, a son
>
> talks to his dad. He's like, do I really have to give my dick away? And the dad
>
> is like,
>
> son, when you meet the right woman. And then, you know, even couples, you know,
>
> like Nadia
>
> and Dimitri.
>
> You only ask them, like, how long they've been together. It wouldn't be like 13
>
> years.
>
> Nadia would be like, I think it's been about 52 dicks. And Dimitri's like, it
>
> was 53. All
>
> the tax savings I've been making. Jesus. All right. That's what I've got for
>
> you guys tonight.
>
> I'm going to go and drink this whiskey. Thanks a lot.
>
> Okay. That was very fussy. Dick philosopher, apparently.
>
> I think it's kind of unprofessional to order whiskey on stage. What do you
>
> think? I'm not
>
> sure. It kind of just...
