<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> This next guy, this is his first time here in tune, and I think you guys are going to love him,
>
> okay?
>
> He's British, but he's been living in Switzerland here for the past 18 years, okay?
>
> And yes, this is his real name. Everybody give it up, it's Harry Fox! Give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox. It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room of English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox. And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halver and Watver, just to give them a fair starting line.
>
> But you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> And honestly, there's only been about this much, I think. If I can share something with you guys
>
> here in the studio. Honestly, it's been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time. Wow. Like food scientists, you're going on
>
> dates with your sister?
>
> Okay, sorry. It's not a question anymore. Alright, so then I hadn't realized I was coming to the
>
> Zug and Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meetup tonight.
>
> So maybe I need to explain my condition to you guys a little bit. Because when you haven't had sex
>
> in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses
>
> and you look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into micro, you go into micro, you spot an acción on watermelon. You get one hand on
>
> that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bang! It's like you're in a new dimension. It's just you and that watermelon. It's getting hot, it's
>
> getting steamy, you're oblivious to the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this voice saying, "You're a man-shin!" And you look and there's an old lady
>
> about to hit you with a handbag and you think, "She's nice."
>
> Yeah, so that's how that is. So how has 2020 been going for you guys? Have you been having a good
>
> 2020 so far?
>
> Have you even been alive in 2020 so far? Are you enjoying 2020? Yes?
>
> Wow, well good for you because I've been having a shitty 2020, you know, because I've been feeling
>
> kind of depressed about all the sex I'm not getting.
>
> And so I did what a real man does in these circumstances. I go on YouTube and watch animal videos.
>
> But then I found an animal that blew my mind. This really cheered me up. Wow, this animal is
>
> incredible. Can you guess what animal I'm talking about?
>
> Okay, when was the last time you went to the zoo? Been a long time, okay.
>
> All right, so let me tell you what animal I'm talking about here. It's the Argonaut octopus. This
>
> creature is incredible.
>
> Now I need to explain this a little bit because the female Argonauts are extremely aggressive.
>
> If the man gets anywhere near them, the female is going to eat him. So the men are terrified of the
>
> females.
>
> I'm sensing that this guy could relate to that, perhaps.
>
> So what the males have done is they've developed a unique solution, and I'm going to have to
>
> explain this in my David Attenborough voice.
>
> Hold on a second. You're not interrupting the show. I'm just going to make it awkward for you.
>
> And the next drink. Do we have any more drinks? I would like a drink. Could I have a ginger beer?
>
> Actually, while I'm here, I think I deserve a whiskey. A free whiskey? Wow, this is working out
>
> fantastic. Thank you.
>
> I'll check whatever whiskey I can get at this point. No, no, I don't drink ice and whiskey. That's
>
> not nice.
>
> Well, I like the Scottish whiskey. All right, good. So that's my other problem, the alcohol problem.
>
> Now, let's get back to the Argonaut octopus, right? So the males have developed a unique solution.
>
> You know David Attenborough? All right, so let me explain this.
>
> So when the male of the species spots a female, he detaches his penis.
>
> The penis swings through the water and hones in on her vagina.
>
> Oh, sorry, not your vagina. Sorry. I kid you not. This is real. There is an octopus out there.
>
> Let me put it in layman's terms. This octopus has a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> That is incredible. Why are we not teaching kids in school about this stuff?
>
> And this really cheered me up. And then I got thinking about it.
>
> Like, wow, wouldn't it be amazing, wouldn't it be amazing if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be crazy. Like, just imagine, it's Monday morning and Samira over there, you know,
>
> she's waiting for the bus, just thinking about all kinds of new ways she can do marketing about oil,
>
> like, thinking about this stuff. And suddenly, like, BAM! This dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She's like, "Oh, fuck!" She has to hide behind some old ladies.
>
> She pulls out her dick shield like Captain America. Dicks are just flying all around, hitting the
>
> shield.
>
> And then she jumps on the bus, she arrives at the oil company, and luckily there's a sign saying,
>
> "Please keep your penis attached during your personas."
>
> That, like, detachable dicks would be crazy, you know.
>
> I mean, we probably have, like, dick-related sports, you know.
>
> You have, like, dick racing. At the Olympics, you've got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike changes its slogan to just dick it. Crazy.
>
> And the more I thought about this, the more I thought this raises more questions than universal
>
> basic income.
>
> You know, like, can you imagine, like, what would happen if you lost your dick?
>
> Wow, that would be crazy. You'd have to hope you've got an app on your phone, like, "Find My Penis."
>
> Or, uh, could you borrow your friend's dick? You know, that would be strange.
>
> That would be like, "I wasn't cheating, it was Alex's dick!" Crazy.
>
> Or, you know, like, Roman, you know, he's been out, he's been heavy drinking, he wakes up in the
>
> morning,
>
> "Thank you for the whiskey at this moment, that really helps the show."
>
> Wow. Roman, Roman has been out drinking whiskey, drinking hard, he wakes up in the morning,
>
> he finds his dick in the corner, and he's like, "What the? Is that covered in crude oil? That is
>
> gross. Jesus."
>
> But then I got thinking, like, what if, what if when you shoot your dick it's a one-time thing,
>
> and then you have to wait three months for your dick to regrow?
>
> Wow, like, OK, there's some ladies here, they'd be like, "That would be fantastic. Finally a break
>
> from the non-stop."
>
> But, you know, young ladies, they'd be like, they'd go out to brunch together, they'd be like,
>
> "Oh, last night it was so romantic, he got down on his knee and he gave me his dick."
>
> It would be crazy. Or, you know, like, a son talks to his dad, he's like,
>
> "You don't really have to give my dick away." And the dad is like, "Son, when you meet the right
>
> woman."
>
> And then, you know, even couples, you know, like Nadia and Dimitri over there,
>
> when you ask them, like, how long they've been together, it wouldn't be like 13 years.
>
> Nadia would be like, "Oh, I think it's been about 52 dicks."
>
> And Dimitri's like, "It was 53! All the tax savings I've been making, Jesus!"
>
> All right, that's what I've got for you guys tonight. I'm going to go and drink this whiskey.
>
> Thanks a lot.
>
> OK, that was Mary Fox and the Dick Philosopher, apparently.
>
> I think it's kind of unprofessional to order whiskey on stage. What do you think? I'm not sure.
