<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> We're talking about athletic people actually. A little while ago I hooked up with a bodybuilding
>
> chick. Have any of you guys done that?
>
> No, you've never hooked up with one of those chicks with a clip?
>
> Some people get weird because they think it plays on Asian stuff.
>
> These are my favorite people. Let's kick the music off.
>
> Yeah, one of the sexiest people on the Zurich scene.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Mr. Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them "how the" and "what the" just to give them a good starting
>
> line.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up to me and he's like, "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fox!
>
> Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> I was like, "What?" He's like, "Exactly! Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> I was like, "Okay, I think I can throw him off with some adverbs. Harry Fux hopefully. Harry Fox
>
> occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fox enthusiastically."
>
> Then he was like, "No, man. No, Harry Fox goats, man. Harry Fox chickens. Harry Fox tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind, no one has
>
> ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> It actually made me realize that there is a whole category of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example. You may get up behind a hippo and be like, "Wow, that is a sweet ass."
>
> Do not do it! Hippos are very dangerous. They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants, you know. It's just too high up. You just can't get it up there.
>
> Of course, if the mum isn't watching, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Alright, alright. I'm just finding your level, you know.
>
> I see you're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> So, before I continue, I've got to make one thing clear.
>
> I identify as an attractive woman.
>
> I'm not gay. I just identify as an attractive woman for the benefits.
>
> In fact, I'll be at the bar after if anyone wants to buy me a drink.
>
> And there are a lot of benefits to being an attractive woman.
>
> For example, recently I went into Starbucks and I ordered a green tea frappuccino.
>
> And the guy said, "Hey, what's your name?"
>
> And I said, "My name is Harry. I'm an attractive woman."
>
> And he said, "Hey, then this drink's on the house."
>
> And I said, "Thank you. Please bring it to my table."
>
> Or, you know, I was driving. I was probably going a bit over the limit.
>
> The police stopped me. They came over and said, "We're going to need some identity."
>
> And I said, "My identity is attractive woman."
>
> And they said, "Oh, OK. Well, you're free to go after you've flown into this."
>
> Now, I should admit, I didn't actually write these jokes.
>
> Some guy wrote them for me.
>
> Because as an attractive woman, I don't even really know if I need to be funny.
>
> But there are some things that are hard about being an attractive woman.
>
> Because, like, recently I was feeling a bit sad, a bit down.
>
> And then I thought, "Wait a second. Hey, I'm on some guy's yacht in the Caribbean."
>
> You know, you've got to appreciate the little things.
>
> Or, you know, another thing that's hard, another thing that's really hard,
>
> I've found it very difficult to connect with ugly women.
>
> Yeah, I know. They give me this face like, "Hmm."
>
> And, "Look, ma'am, don't let me make you feel uncomfortable. I'm not going to steal your boyfriend."
>
> I mean, look at him.
>
> No, but, you know, it's not my fault.
>
> It's not my fault that your dad wants to sleep with me.
>
> Because I'm a good person, you know.
>
> I believe that 99% of women should get equal pay.
>
> They need it for the makeup.
>
> Tension in here is fantastic.
>
> But I identify as an attractive woman, so I don't care.
>
> All right, all right. Obviously, I'm not an attractive woman at all.
>
> In fact, I'm a creepy guy.
>
> One of the problems about being a creepy guy is young people, especially young women, they're just
>
> like, "Eww."
>
> But I'm like, "Hey, don't worry, because I don't want to sleep with you. You're just too young."
>
> I don't sleep with anyone under 25.
>
> Because I believe that reincarnation could be a thing.
>
> And I don't want to risk that it's my grandmother I'm fucking.
>
> Wow, that would be gross. She was a sweet old lady.
>
> You know, I mean, it might be her first orgasm.
>
> Women didn't have orgasms back then.
>
> Wow, I love this.
>
> We've taken this show through the floor.
>
> And that's all I've got.
>
> Have a fantastic night.
>
> Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> The most attractive woman on stage tonight.
>
> But guys, that's the end of the first half.
>
> You guys did amazingly making it through there.
>
> Thank you so much. Thank you to the standing crew.
>
> We're going to come back in about 10 minutes. We have a very short break.
>
> We've got about five more acts in the second half.
>
> It's going to get a little dark, a little dirtier.
>
> Have a few more drinks, go smoke, get high, do whatever the ecstasy, I'm sure, over on that side of
>
> the room.
>
> One more time to all the comics on the first half, please.
>
> Big round of applause for all the comics on the second half.
>
> We'll be back in 10 minutes. Thank you.
