>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fooks
>
> is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist
>
> came up to me, he's like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fooks. Harry Fooks what, man?"
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fooks. Harry Fooks what, man?"
>

>
> But he was like,
>
> "No, man. No. Harry Fooks goats, man.
>
> Harry Fooks chickens. Harry Fooks
>
> tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know
>
> about you, but I'm pretty sure
>
> that in the entire history
>
> of mankind, no one
>
> has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> It actually made me realize that there is
>
> a whole category
>
> of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> You make out a
>
> hippo and you're like, "Wow. That is a sweet ass."
>
> Do not do it.
>
> Hippos are very dangerous. They kill about
>
> 500 people every year.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants, you know.
>
> It's just too high up. You just can't get it up there.
>
> Of course, if the mum isn't watching, you could
>
> probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Alright, alright. I'm just finding your level,
>
> you know. I see you're
>
> okay with bestiality, but not
>
> pedophiles, you see.
>
> Alright, okay.
>
> So, before I
>
> continue, I gotta make one
>
> thing clear.
>
> I identify
>
> as an attractive woman.
>
> I'm not gay. I just identify
>
> as an attractive
>
> woman. For the benefits.
>
> You know.
>
> In fact, I'll be at the bar after if anyone wants
>
> to buy me a drink.
>
> You know. And there are a lot
>
> of benefits to being an attractive woman.
>
> Like, for example, recently I went into Starbucks
>
> and I ordered a green tea
>
> frappuccino.
>
> And the guy said, "Hey, what's your name?"
>
> And I said, "My name is Harry.
>
> I'm an attractive woman."
>
> And he said, "Hey,
>
> then this drink's on the
>
> house."
>
> And I said, "Thank you. Please bring it
>
> to my table."
>
> Or, you know,
>
> I was driving. I was probably going a bit over the limit.
>
> The police stopped me.
>
> They came over and said, "We're going to need some
>
> identity." And I said,
>
> "My identity
>
> is attractive woman."
>
> And they said,
>
> "Oh, okay. Well, you're free to go."
>
> "After you've flown into this."
>
> Now, I should
>
> admit, I didn't actually write
>
> these jokes. Some guy
>
> wrote them for me.
>
> Because as an attractive
>
> woman, I don't even really know
>
> if I need to be funny.
>
> But there are
>
> some things that are hard about being
>
> an attractive woman. Because, like, recently
>
> I was feeling a bit sad, a bit down.
>
> And then I thought, wait a second,
>
> hey, I'm on some
>
> guy's yacht
>
> in the Caribbean.
>
> You know, you've got to appreciate
>
> the little things.
>
> Or, you know, another thing
>
> that's hard, another thing that's really hard,
>
> I find it very difficult
>
> to connect with ugly women.
>
> Yeah, I know.
>
> They give me this, they give me this
>
> face, like...
>
> Look, ma'am, don't let me make
>
> you feel uncomfortable. I'm not going to steal your
>
> boyfriend. I mean, look at him.
>
> No, but, you know,
>
> and, you know, it's not my fault.
>
> It's not my fault that
>
> your dad wants to sleep with me.
>
> Because I'm a good
>
> person, you know. I believe
>
> that 99% of women
>
> should get equal pay.
>
> They need it for the makeup.
>
> Wow.
>
> The tension in here is fantastic.
>
> But I identify
>
> as an attractive woman,
>
> so I don't care.
>
> So...
>
> Alright, alright. Obviously
>
> I'm not an attractive woman at all.
>
> In fact, I'm a creepy guy.
>
> You know.
>
> One of the problems about being a creepy guy
>
> is young people,
>
> especially young women, they're just like, "Eww!"
>
> But I'm like, "Hey, don't worry."
>
> Because I don't want to sleep with you.
>
> You're just too young. I don't sleep with anyone
>
> under 25. Because
>
> I believe that reincarnation
>
> could be a thing.
>
> And I don't want to risk that it's my grandmother
>
> I'm fucking.
>
> Wow, that would be gross. She was a sweet
>
> old lady.
>
> You know. I mean, it might be her first orgasm.
>
> Women didn't have
>
> orgasms back then.
>
> Wow, I love it.
>
> It's good to be taking this show
>
> through the floor. And that's all I've got!
>
> Have a fantastic night,
>
> everybody.
>
> Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> The most attractive woman on stage
>
> tonight.
>
> But guys, that's the end of the first half. You guys did amazingly
>
> make it through that. Thank you so much. Thank you to the standing crew.
>
> We're going to come back in about 10 minutes
>
> We have a very short break. We've got about five more
>
> acts in the second half. It's going to get a little dark, a little
>
> dirtier. Have a few more drinks. Go smoke.
>
> Get high. Do it out in the ecstasy, I'm sure.
>
> Over on that side of the room. One more time to all the comics
>
> in the first half, please. Big round of applause for all the
>
> boys and girls. We'll be back in 10 minutes!
>
> Thank you!
>
> She's crazy like...
>
> Oh my god.
