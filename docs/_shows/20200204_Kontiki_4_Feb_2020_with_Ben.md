> Folks, we only have one last act left in tonight's show.
>
> Before, I do want to tell you guys a couple of things.
>
> You might have seen these flyers on your seats.
>
> These are the upcoming shows we have next week here in Zurich.
>
> On Sunday, it's the American Stand-Up Show
>
> with this really funny guy from Los Angeles, Brian Vogey.
>
> That's that. Also, next Thursday, not this one,
>
> next Thursday, right here in Quintiki,
>
> we are going to have Comic Strip Zurich, okay?
>
> It's burlesque meets stand-up comedy, so you gotta check that out.
>
> Also, we do have other open mics, like ACID,
>
> so please check all of that out.
>
> Also, after the show, Christian will be there at the door
>
> with our donation box, okay, because this is a donation-based show.
>
> We make it run with your donations, so, you know, please, donate.
>
> That's it.
>
> I'm always weird asking this.
>
> So, let's bring up our last comedian of tonight.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited.
>
> This guy is originally British, but he's been living here in Switzerland
>
> for the past 18 years.
>
> And, yes, this is his real name.
>
> Give it up. It's Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So, my name is actually Harry "Fux."
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry "Fux."
>
> My name is not Harry "Fux."
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them "Halva" and "Walva"
>
> just to give them a good starting line.
>
> No, but actually, this is true, because I'm a single dad,
>
> and I have two teenage kids.
>
> They live with me, and living with two teenage kids,
>
> it's like living in a student flat share.
>
> 'Cause, like, there's never any milk.
>
> It's always a fucking mess.
>
> And I get to pay for everything!
>
> It's the shittest flat share ever.
>
> But the good news tonight is I get to get some revenge,
>
> because Ben is here, my teenage son.
>
> Wow!
>
> It's time you get your ass up here, man.
>
> Let's come up here.
>
> Come on, let's see the...
>
> I shouldn't be here, so...
>
> How are you doing, Ben?
>
> - Doing all right.
>
> - Is this the most awkward experience
>
> I've ever put you through?
>
> - Yeah, kind of.
>
> - Fantastic, I love it already.
>
> So, Ben, you know, now, the good thing about this
>
> is that I get to ask questions
>
> that normally he wouldn't answer.
>
> Like, "So, Ben, how's it going with the ladies?"
>
> - Oh, okay, that's harsh.
>
> - Yeah, exactly, well, yeah.
>
> Actually, the truth, he confessed this to me.
>
> You know, he's actually having a really hard time
>
> with the ladies, because he's actually
>
> already been rejected over 50 times
>
> by the same girl.
>
> Yeah, it's really tough, but, you know,
>
> I mean, the thing that I have to give him
>
> some sympathy for is 'cause, you know,
>
> when I was young, being a young guy,
>
> it was just easy, you just did your shit.
>
> Nowadays, like, Instagram, you need a six-pack
>
> and stuff like that, how is that for you?
>
> - Doing fucking great.
>
> - Of course, honestly, he has a kind of
>
> negative body image, you know,
>
> because there's some man boobs here.
>
> And the worst part is the left boob is bigger than the right.
>
> It's extremely hard.
>
> Actually, I should stop this.
>
> The real stuff is he does Thai boxing,
>
> and in a minute, he's just gonna knee me in the balls.
>
> Exactly, he's 14, and like, it's ending up here,
>
> and then I'm gonna be like, "I'm sorry, Ben!"
>
> Yeah, so, but no, I do think he does some things
>
> that are really cool, you know.
>
> I'm just not gonna let him speak.
>
> He just has to stand here awkwardly.
>
> Like for example, you know, he plays GTA a lot.
>
> You know, he's a big gamer, and, you know,
>
> "Wow, well, thank you for that."
>
> I would have expected most people, like,
>
> "How can you let your son play that game
>
> "where he gets to beat up hookers?"
>
> But I'm like, "I think it's actually teaching him
>
> "some important life skills."
>
> Because, "What the fuck are you doing, motherfucker?
>
> "Give me that!
>
> "I--
>
> "Right, take it back again, man.
>
> "Jesus.
>
> "Get your horn skills correct, man.
>
> "It's for the racism.
>
> "We haven't got to the racism part yet.
>
> "All right."
>
> - I'm trying to defend yourself.
>
> - Back to, yeah, well, he can defend himself
>
> after in a few years, okay?
>
> That's how that's gonna work.
>
> Now, so, you know, let's get back
>
> to the beating up hookers, because
>
> what I do find is very impressive is that actually,
>
> as a gamer, he's learned to sit still in a chair
>
> for eight hours without eating, speaking,
>
> or going to the toilet.
>
> Which is clearly fantastic preparation
>
> for future office life.
>
> I'm very happy with this.
>
> And he plays online, and I really like
>
> how it's improved his English,
>
> 'cause he's learned some key phrases like,
>
> "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> "I will piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> Just makes me like, ah, chip off the old block there.
>
> But, you know, I think the thing is like being a dad
>
> is often I'm confronted with very awkward situations.
>
> This is gonna get even worse, Ben.
>
> 'Cause it's time we talk about how recently
>
> I caught him looking at porn.
>
> Luckily, I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> I could point him at all the best categories.
>
> And we've come to a kind of an arrangement now.
>
> Like right now, he gets like boobs and butts
>
> and blowjobs, you know, just the kind of the safe stuff.
>
> For his birthday, he's getting lesbians,
>
> because, you know, I think men,
>
> it's important, yeah, thank you, you know.
>
> Men, we need things to fantasize about
>
> that we will never see in our life, you know?
>
> Any lesbians here tonight?
>
> No, they're like ninjas, you never see them.
>
> Yeah, but how was it for you getting caught
>
> looking at porn, Ben?
>
> You know, it was kind of cringe, I have to say.
>
> But you know what's worse?
>
> What's what?
>
> Getting...
>
> Oh, God.
>
> Sorry, man.
>
> Sorry.
>
> All right, wait a minute.
>
> We're gonna make you look at it.
>
> Ben, how was, okay, we're gonna rewind.
>
> Ben, how was it for you getting caught looking at porn?
>
> You know what's worse?
>
> Catching your dog watch porn.
>
> Yeah, that shit goes to the scars for you.
>
> And mostly if it's fucking milk porn.
>
> He's got me.
>
> I think on that note, I think I'm,
>
> get back to your chair, go do some homework.
>
> Jesus.
>
> That was his first time on stage, you know.
>
> That was either the greatest parental moment
>
> or the worst, you know.
>
> But, you know, at least I'm not a helicopter parent
>
> like Kobe Bryant.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I'm sorry that joke just didn't land, okay.
>
> There's a Kobe sign at the back there.
>
> All right, all right.
>
> So where are we gonna go from here?
>
> How long have I got?
>
> I'm just sort of--
>
> - One minute.
>
> - One minute.
>
> Ben, should we go, let me make this better for you.
>
> So Ben has an older sister.
>
> Should I tell a joke about your older sister?
>
> - Yeah, you should.
>
> - Yeah, that's gonna lift up Ben
>
> because I do have a teenage daughter
>
> and being a single dad with a teenage daughter
>
> is insanely hard.
>
> I'm constantly being confronted with situations
>
> I'm wholly unprepared for.
>
> 'Cause like recently, I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom and oh my God,
>
> it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror,
>
> drops of blood on the sink, more blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming and I looked around
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, Ben's sister arrived
>
> and she said like, "Hey dad, I got my period."
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> I was like, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Okay, now obviously this is a job
>
> that I am wholly unqualified for.
>
> But I thought, you know, naively as a man,
>
> I'm like, "Yeah, this can't be so hard."
>
> So I went over to Migo, I took a look around
>
> and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> This guy, Mr. Hip said,
>
> "Do you know what type of tampon she uses?
>
> "Do you have the brand?
>
> "You need to know that shit.
>
> "This relationship's gonna have a future.
>
> "Figure that shit out."
>
> Because, you know, here's what I found,
>
> is that I found that, you know,
>
> you've got names like OB Pro.
>
> What the hell is this?
>
> For professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> Doesn't sound like something I want for my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> What are we saying here?
>
> Like glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> So when the lights are up, you can just cram it in there?
>
> The one I liked the most was Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's amazing, it's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> 'Cause around about 10 o'clock, this thing starts to leak
>
> and she is always home by 11.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> And this whole experience,
>
> it was a very proud one for me as a father.
>
> Because it's not every day you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> All right, so now all of you think I'm a shitty parent.
>
> Well, guess what?
>
> Adopt this kid, I don't care.
>
> Nah, sorry, man.
>
> Ben Bigwood, give it up not to me, to Ben.
>
> Okay, wow, fuck, we made it to the end.
