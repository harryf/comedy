> Folks, we only have one last act left in tonight's show.
>
> Before, I do want to tell you guys a couple of things.
>
> You might have seen these flyers on your seats.
>
> These are the upcoming shows we have next week here in Zurich.
>
> On Sunday, it's the American Stand-Up Show with this really funny guy from Los
>
> Angeles, Brian Boke.
>
> That's that.
>
> Also, next Thursday, not this one, next Thursday, right here in Kon-Tiki,
>
> we are going to have Comic Strip Zurich, okay?
>
> It's burlesque meets stand-up comedy, so you've got to check that out.
>
> Also, we do have other open mics, like Acid, so please check all of that out.
>
> Also, after the show, Christian will be there at the door with our donation box,
>
> okay?
>
> Because this is a donation-based show.
>
> We make it run with your donations, so, you know, please donate. That's it.
>
> I'm always weird asking this.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, so let's bring up our last comedian of tonight.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited.
>
> This guy is originally British, but he's been living here in Switzerland for
>
> the past 18 years.
>
> And yes, this...
>
> This is his real name.
>
> Give it up.
>
> It's Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Yes, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when
>
> you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halva and Watha.
>
> Just to give them a good starting line.
>
> No, but actually, and this is true, because I'm a single dad, and I have two
>
> teenage kids.
>
> They live with me.
>
> And living with two teenage kids, it's like living in a student Vegas, a
>
> student flat share.
>
> Because, like, there's never any milk.
>
> It's always a fucking mess.
>
> And I get to pay for everything.
>
> It's the shittest flat share ever.
>
> But the good news tonight is I get to get some revenge.
>
> Because Ben is here.
>
> My teenage son.
>
> Wow.
>
> It's time you get your ass up here, man.
>
> Let's come up here.
>
> Come on, Ben.
>
> How are you doing, Ben?
>
> Doing alright.
>
> Is this the most awkward?
>
> Is this the most awkward experience I've ever put you through?
>
> Yeah, kind of.
>
> Fantastic.
>
> I love it already.
>
> So, Ben, you know, now the good thing about this is that I get to ask questions
>
> that normally he wouldn't answer.
>
> Like, so, Ben, how's it going with the ladies?
>
> Oh, okay.
>
> That's harsh.
>
> Yeah, exactly.
>
> Yeah, actually, the truth, he confesses to me, you know, he's actually having a
>
> really hard time with the ladies.
>
> Because he's actually already been rejected over 50 times by the same girl.
>
> Yeah, it's really tough.
>
> But, you know, I mean, the thing that I have to give him some sympathy for is
>
> because, you know, when I was young, being a young guy was just easy.
>
> You just did your shit.
>
> Nowadays, like, Instagram, you need a six-pack and stuff like that.
>
> How is that for you?
>
> Doing fucking great.
>
> Of course, honestly, he has a kind of negative body image, you know, because
>
> there's some man boobs here.
>
> And the worst part is the left boob is bigger than the right.
>
> It's extremely hard.
>
> Actually, I should stop this.
>
> The real stuff is he does Thai boxing, and in a minute, he's just going to knee
>
> me in the balls.
>
> Exactly.
>
> He's 14, and, like, it's ending up here.
>
> And then I'm going to be like, I'm sorry, Ben.
>
> Yeah, so, but no, I do think he does some things that are really cool.
>
> You know, I'm just not going to let him speak.
>
> He just has to stand here awkwardly.
>
> Like, for example, you know, he plays GTA a lot.
>
> You know, he's a big gamer.
>
> And, you know, wow, well, thank you for that.
>
> I would have expected most people, like, how can you let your son play that
>
> game where he gets to beat?
>
> I would have expected most people, like, how can you let your son play that

>
> bookers. But I'm like, I think it's actually teaching him some important life
>
> skills. What
>
> the fuck are you doing, motherfucker? Give me that. I... Wait, take it back
>
> again, man.
>
> Jesus. Get your horn skills correct, man. It's for the racism. We haven't got
>
> to the
>
> racist part yet. All right. I'm trying to defend yourself. Back to... Yeah,
>
> well, he
>
> can defend himself after in a few years. Okay, that's how it's going to work.
>
> Now, so, you
>
> know, let's get back to the beating up hookers, because what I do find is very
>
> impressive
>
> is that actually, as a gamer, he's learned to sit still in a chair for eight
>
> hours without
>
> eating, speaking, or going to the toilet, which is clearly fantastic
>
> preparation for
>
> future office life. I'm very happy with this. And he plays online.
>
> And I really like how it's improved his English, because he's learned some key
>
> phrases like,
>
> bitch, I will fuck you up. I will piss on you like Donald Trump.
>
> Just makes me like that. Chip off the old block there. But, you know, I think
>
> the thing
>
> is, like, being a dad is often I'm confronted with very awkward situations.
>
> This is going
>
> to get even worse, Ben. Because it's time we talk about how recently...
>
> I caught him looking at porn. Luckily, I'm a bit of an expert. I could point
>
> him at all
>
> the best categories. And we've come to a kind of an arrangement now. Like,
>
> right now, he
>
> gets, like, boobs and butts and blowjobs, you know, just kind of the safe stuff.
>
> For
>
> his birthday, he's getting lesbians, because, you know, I think men, it's
>
> important. Yeah,
>
> thank you.
>
> Men, we need things to fantasize about that we will never see in our life, you
>
> know? Any
>
> lesbians here tonight? No, they're like ninjas. You never see them. Yeah, but
>
> how was it for
>
> you getting caught looking at porn, Ben?
>
> You know, it was kind of cringe, I have to say. But you know what's worse?
>
> What's that?
>
> Getting...
>
> Oh, okay.
>
> Oh, boy.
>
> Sorry, mate.
>
> All right, wait, wait, we're going to repeat over. Ben, how was... Okay, we're
>
> going to
>
> rewind. Ben, how was it for you getting caught looking at porn?
>
> You know what's worse? Catching your dad watch porn.
>
> Yeah, that's your... That's your scars for life.
>
> I'm mostly if it's fucking milf porn.
>
> He's got me. I think on that note, I think I'm, get back to your chair, go do
>
> some homework.
>
> Jesus.
>
> That was his first time on stage, you know? That was either the greatest
>
> parental moment
>
> or the worst, you know? But, you know, at least I'm not a helicopter parent
>
> like Kobe Bryant.
>
> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that joke just didn't land, okay?
>
> All right, so where are we going to go from here? How long have I got? I'm just
>
> sort of...
>
> One minute.
>
> One minute. Ben, should we, should we go, let me, let me make this better for
>
> you. So Ben has an older sister.
>
> Should I tell a joke about your older sister?
>
> Yeah.
>
> Yeah, that's going to, that's going to lift up Ben because I do have a teenage
>
> daughter
>
> and being a single dad with a teenage daughter is insanely hard. I'm constantly
>
> being confronted
>
> with situations I'm wholly unprepared for. Because I recently, I came back from
>
> work.
>
> I went into the bathroom and oh my God, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror, drops of blood on the sink.
>
> More blood on the floor and the toilet looked like something from a horror
>
> movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming and I looked around and I realized the screaming
>
> was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, Ben's sister arrived and she said like, hey dad, I got my
>
> period.
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood, I was like, hey, can I get you
>
> something? And she said,
>
> dad, get me tampons.
>
> Okay, now obviously this is a job that I am wholly unqualified for.
>
> But I thought, you know, naively as a man, I'm like, yeah, this can't be so
>
> hard.
>
> So I went over to Migo, I took a look around and what I discovered is that tampon
>
> product
>
> names are exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> This guy, Mr. Hip said, do you know what type of tampon she uses?
>
> Do you have the brand?
>
> You need to know that.
>
> This relationship is going to have a future.
>
> Figure that shit out, because, you know, here's what I found is that I found
>
> that, you know,
>
> you've got names like OB Pro.
>
> What the hell is this for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> Doesn't sound like something I want for my daughter or Tampax Radiance.
>
> What are we saying here? Like glow in the dark tampon.
>
> So when the lights are up, you can just cram it in there.
>
> The one I liked the most was Always Infinity, for when your vagina is an unfillable
>
> black hole.
>
> But I ended up, I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> Because around about 10 o'clock, this thing starts to leak and she is always
>
> home by 11.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> And this whole experience is amazing.
>
> It was a very proud one for me as a father, because it's not every day you get
>
> to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> All right, so now all of you think I'm a shitty parent.
>
> Well, guess what?
>
> Adopt this kid.
>
> I don't care.
>
> Give it up.
>
> Not to me.
>
> To Ben.
>
> Thank you guys.
>
> You've been a lot of fun.
>
> Okay, wow, fuck.
>
> We made it to the end.
