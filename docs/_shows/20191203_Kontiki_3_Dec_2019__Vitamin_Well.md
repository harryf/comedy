> Yo, give it up for Janesh, everybody!
>
> Cool, guys. We have one more comedian in the first half.
>
> Uh...
>
> You guys don't give a fuck. This is awesome.
>
> He's probably one of the sexiest comedians I've ever seen in my entire life.
>
> Uh... give it up for Harry Fuchs, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> Because in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halver and Walther.
>
> But you see, the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Recently, this guy came up to me and he was like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fuchs! Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "Exactly! Harry Fuchs what?"
>
> And I'm like, "OK."
>
> I think I can throw him off with some adverbs like, uh...
>
> "Harry Fuchs hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fuchs occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> And he was like, "No, man. No."
>
> "I mean, Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens. Harry Fuchs tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> In fact, this made me realize that there is a whole category of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you might get up behind a hippo and be like, "Mmm, that is a sweet ass."
>
> "Don't do it. Hippos are the most dangerous land mammal. They kill about 500 people every year."
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants, for example. It's just too high. It's like, you can't get up there.
>
> OK, I mean, if the mum isn't watching, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Alright, I'm just finding your level. You seem to be OK with bestiality, not pedophile bestiality.
>
> OK, I think I got you.
>
> Alright, so, change of topic.
>
> You know, recently, I got on Instagram.
>
> Anyone here on Instagram? Give it up if you're on Instagram.
>
> Give it up if you hate Instagram.
>
> Wow, OK. Well, you know, I'm kind of with these people.
>
> It took me a long time to get on Instagram.
>
> Because I always thought that it was a festering cesspool of narcissists and sociopaths.
>
> And then I thought, "Wait a second. These are my people."
>
> But there is one thing about Instagram that still, just when I see that, I just fill up with rage.
>
> And that is selfies with inspirational quotes on them.
>
> Oh my God, you know, those inspirational quotes, when I see them, my brain just puts subtitles
>
> underneath.
>
> And if you could see them, Instagram would be a whole lot less inspirational.
>
> For example, "Be yourself. There's no one better."
>
> Yeah, seven billion people might disagree with that.
>
> "If you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine."
>
> What, so you cause skin cancer?
>
> "Living my best life."
>
> Yeah, and if that's your best life, maybe it needs to come to an end.
>
> All right, excuse me a second.
>
> Any of you guys drink these things, vitamin well?
>
> I can't stop drinking these things.
>
> These are genius marketing.
>
> Marketing person, I give it up to your people.
>
> Because, you know, what is this thing?
>
> It is a bottle of bullshit, wrapped in some marketing, with a word.
>
> And when I see this word, I just believe, like, "Reload."
>
> I am reloaded right now, holy shit.
>
> And they have other words like "awake" and "antioxidant."
>
> And I'm like, I wonder what other words they could put on this.
>
> Like, I need more words.
>
> Like, obviously, I need "sexy."
>
> You know, I just drink a bottle of that, get chased down the street
>
> by a herd of stampeding women.
>
> Or maybe "clever," so that I can be smart enough to stop drinking this shit.
>
> Or maybe even "funny," I would be the best comedian in the world.
>
> Okay, you guys obviously need a bottle of "laugh."
>
> So, you know, and Dean probably needs a bottle of "enthusiasm."
>
> Let's give it up, let's just take a moment, give it up for Dean.
>
> Give this man some "enthusiasm."
>
> This is his first night, and he's doing miserably.
>
> We'll bring him back up again.
>
> But, you know, there's probably also some negative words you could put on there.
>
> Like, "I drank a bottle of anger."
>
> "A man was eye-pissed."
>
> Oh my God, or "I drank five bottles of frustration, and nothing happened."
>
> My God.
>
> "Drunk a bottle of regret."
>
> That was a big mistake.
>
> "Went to a party, you know, with a friend, and it was the worst party ever."
>
> "They just served up a cocktail of sorrow and disappointment."
>
> That's what the potential of this thing is, that's what the marketing people are going
>
> to bring us in the future.
>
> We just have words, and then we just believe.
>
> But, you know, the funny thing about the future, I was reading something recently that we're
>
> only about five to ten years away from human cloning.
>
> And I've always wanted to, I've always thought that would be amazing, wouldn't it be amazing
>
> to meet your own clone?
>
> But then I thought, "Wait, this may go badly, because we'd just be like two bossy assholes,
>
> we'd probably hate each other, there's this awkward silence when we meet, and then one
>
> of us or the other is going to be like, 'So how about a handjob?'"
>
> Think about it, think about it, this is your clone.
>
> Your clone knows everything about your genitals, we're talking the greatest handjob ever.
>
> And then, you know, the next thing is going to be like, "Hmm, I wonder if it's gay to
>
> blow your clone?
>
> And what about spit or swallow?"
>
> Okay, now it's got really awkward, and that's probably how it would be after this despicable
>
> act, you'd be like, "Dude, why the fuck did you convince me to do this shit?
>
> This is disgusting, I need a bottle of regret right now."
>
> And then there's going to be more awkward silence, and then it's going to be like, "Another
>
> handjob?"
>
> And that, I think, could be the future of humanity, we're just at home with our clones
>
> getting amazing handjobs while the whole world falls apart.
>
> All right, I think this show is falling apart right now.
>
> Thank you guys, you've been kind as fuck.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Slightly depressing, but slightly arousing.
>
> Cool, thank you for actually staying until the end of our first half, I appreciate it.
>
> So we're going to have a break now, 15 minutes, go get yourself a drink, grab a cigarette,
>
> go wax a mustache, everything will be fine, and then come back, we'll see you guys in
