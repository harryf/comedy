> Yo, give it up for Jen Nash, everybody!
>
> Cool, guys, we have one more comedian in the first half.
>
> You guys don't give a fuck. This is awesome.
>
> He's probably one of the sexiest comedians I've ever seen in my entire life.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Because in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them how-the and what-the.
>
> But you see, the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is I get a lot of
>
> stupid comments.
>
> Like, recently this guy came up to me and he was like, "Yo, what's up, man?
>
> Harry Fuchs! Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> And he's like, "Exactly! Harry Fuchs what?"
>
> And I'm like, "Okay."
>
> I think I can throw him off with some adverbs like, uh, "Harry Fuchs hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fuchs occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> And he's like, "No, man, no. I mean Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs
>
> chickens. Harry Fuchs tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you.
>
> But I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind, no one has ever
>
> successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> In fact, in fact, this made me realize that there is a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you, you might get up behind a hippo and be like, "Ooh, that is a sweet
>
> ass."
>
> Don't do it. Hippos are the most dangerous land mammal. They kill about 500
>
> people every year.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants, for example. It's just too high. It's like, you can't, can't get
>
> up there.
>
> Okay, I mean, if the mum isn't watching, you could probably fuck a baby
>
> elephant.
>
> Alright, I'm, I'm just finding your level.
>
> You seem to be okay with bestiality, not pedophile bestiality.
>
> Okay, I think I got you.
>
> Alright, so, change of topic.
>
> You know, recently, recently I got on Instagram. I thought I needed...
>
> Anyone here on Instagram? Give it up for me.
>
> Give it up if you're on Instagram.
>
> Give it up if you hate Instagram.
>
> Wow, okay, well, you know, I'm kind of with these people.
>
> It took me a long time to get on Instagram.
>
> Because I always thought that it was a festering cesspool of narcissists and
>
> sociopaths.
>
> And then I thought, wait a second.
>
> These are my people.
>
> But there is one thing about Instagram
>
> that's still just, when I see that, I just fill up with rage.
>
> And that is selfies with inspirational quotes on them.
>
> Oh my God, you know.
>
> Those inspirational quotes, when I see them, my brain just puts subtitles
>
> underneath.
>
> And if you could see them, Instagram would be a whole lot less inspirational.
>
> For example, "Be yourself! There's no one better."
>
> Yes, seven billion people might disagree with that.
>
> If you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine.
>
> What, so you cause skin cancer?
>
> Living my best life!
>
> Yeah, and if that's your best life, maybe it needs to come to an end.
>
> All right, excuse me a second.
>
> Do any of you guys drink these things, vitamin well?
>
> I can't stop drinking these things.
>
> These are genius marketers.
>
> Genius marketing, marketing person, I give it up to your people.
>
> Because, you know, what is this thing?
>
> It is a bottle of bullshit wrapped in some marketing with a word.
>
> And when I see this word, I just believe, like, reload.
>
> I am reloaded right now, holy shit!
>
> And they have other words like awake
>
> and antioxidant.
>
> And I'm like, I wonder what other words they could put on this.
>
> Like, I need more words.
>
> Like, obviously, I need sexy.
>
> You know, I just drink a bottle of that, get chased down the street by a herd
>
> of stampeding women.
>
> Or maybe clever, so that I can be smart enough to stop drinking this shit.
>
> Or maybe even funny, I would be the best comedian in the world.
>
> Okay, you guys obviously need a bottle of laugh.
>
> So, you know, and Dean probably needs a bottle of enthusiasm.
>
> Let's give it up.
>
> Let's just take a moment.
>
> Give it up for Dean.
>
> Give this man some enthusiasm.
>
> This is his first night and he's doing miserably.
>
> We'll bring him back up again.
>
> But, you know, there's probably also some negative words you could put on there.
>
> Like, I drank a bottle of anger.
>
> And, man, was I pissed.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> Or, I drank five bottles of frustration and nothing happened.
>
> My God.
>
> Drunk a bottle of regret.
>
> That was a big mistake.
>
> Went to a party, you know, with a friend.
>
> And it was the worst party ever.
>
> They just served up a cocktail of sorrow and disappointment.
>
> That's what the potential of this thing is.
>
> That's what the marketing people are going to bring us in the future.
>
> We just have words and then we just believe.
>
> But, you know, funny thing about the future.
>
> I was reading something recently that we're only about five to ten years away
>
> from human cloning.
>
> And I've always wanted to -- I've always thought that would be amazing.
>
> Wouldn't it be amazing to meet your own clone?
>
> But then I thought, wait, this may go badly because we'd just be like two bossy
>
> assholes.
>
> We probably hate each other.
>
> There's this awkward silence when we meet.
>
> And then one of us or the other is going to be like, so how about a hand job?
>
> Think about it.
>
> Think about it.
>
> This is your clone.
>
> Your clone knows everything about your genitals.
>
> We're talking the greatest hand job ever.
>
> And then, you know, the next thing is going to be like, hmm, I wonder if it's
>
> gay to blow your clone.
>
> And what about spit or swallow?
>
> Okay, now it's got really awkward.
>
> And that's probably how it would be after this despicable act.
>
> You'd be like, dude, why the fuck did you convince me to do this shit?
>
> This is disgusting.
>
> I need a bottle of regret right now.
>
> And then there's going to be more awkward silence.
>
> And then it's going to be like, another hand job?
>
> And that, I think, could be the future of humanity.
>
> We're just a clone with our clones.
>
> With our clones getting amazing hand jobs while the whole world falls apart.
>
> All right.
>
> I think this show is falling apart right now.
>
> Thank you, guys.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> Slightly depressing and slightly arousing.
>
> Cool.
>
> Thank you for actually staying until the end of our first half.
>
> I appreciate it.
>
> So we're going to have a break now.
>
> Fifteen minutes.
>
> Go get yourself a drink.
>
> Grab a cigarette.
>
> Go wax a mustache.
>
> Everything will be fine.
>
> And then come back.
