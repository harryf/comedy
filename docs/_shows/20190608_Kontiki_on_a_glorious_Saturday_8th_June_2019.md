> Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it. We have made it. This is the last act of
>
> tonight.
>
> I know you guys are excited to meet this last comedian of tonight, so let's not
>
> waste any time.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, he is the sexiest comedian here in the Zurich comedy
>
> scene.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fuchs, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S, I
>
> repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room of English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is
>
> Harry Fuchs, but my name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> My family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call
>
> us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halbert and Walbert.
>
> I didn't want them to get bullied at school, you know.
>
> But, you know, the problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is people are always
>
> coming up to me and saying stupid shit.
>
> For example, recently this American tourist came up to me and he's like, "Yo,
>
> what's up, man? Harry Fuchs! Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> "Harry Fuchs what, man? Exactly. Harry Fuchs what?"
>
> I'm like, "Okay, let me see if I can throw him off with some adverbs. Harry Fuchs
>
> hopefully. Harry Fuchs occasionally. Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> He's like, "No, man. No. Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens. Harry Fuchs
>
> tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of
>
> mankind, no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> But actually, I realized at that moment that actually there is a whole class of
>
> unfuckable animals, like hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you may get up behind a hippo and think, "Hmm, that is a sweet ass. Don't
>
> do it. Hippos kill 500 people every year in Africa. They're the most dangerous
>
> mammal. Do not fuck with hippos."
>
> Well, elephants. Elephants, for example, because it's so high up. I mean, maybe
>
> Tim Comanche is like, "Yeah, I can do that."
>
> It's not happening. But maybe if the mum isn't looking, you could probably fuck
>
> a baby elephant.
>
> All right. I'm just finding your level. I'm finding your level. You're okay
>
> with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> I'll avoid that from now on. But I do have to confess, I do have a lot of dark
>
> thoughts going on in my head, a lot of dark and twisted stuff.
>
> And I think it goes back to my childhood, you know, because I went to a
>
> Catholic school and I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> - That's Tim from Manchester. - Tim, welcome back. Tim! Tim! Tim knows what I'm
>
> talking about.
>
> But actually, I'm not the only person with dark and twisted thoughts. You know
>
> who else has got a lot of fucked up shit going on in their head?
>
> PhD students. Seriously, PhD students. Take Cedric, for example. Cedric, he's
>
> there. He's been working on his thesis all day, on his robot thesis.
>
> And he's like, it's three in the morning. He's been typing since 9 a.m. Three
>
> in the morning now. He's tired.
>
> But he's got a head full of equations and statistical models and robot limbs.
>
> And he's like, "How am I going to get to sleep?
>
> I haven't even... And then he remembers, "I haven't seen my girlfriend for,
>
> like, nine months." And, old timey, he's on Pornhub.
>
> And then, you know, I mean, the average PhD, you've got to understand, it takes
>
> about eight years to complete.
>
> Cedric, we're not talking wholesome porn here, are we? We're talking, like,
>
> stuff about porn with your stent mom, DDSM,
>
> dwarves riding on ponies, you know, because Cedric also watched Game of Thrones.
>
> For you to think about, I want to give it to you. But, you know, the thing is,
>
> it's really, like, with these fucked-up PhD students,
>
> what happens is, at some point, they get their dream job. They get their dream
>
> job at a place like Google.
>
> And Google stuffs them in an office, in these tiny offices, with 10 other horny
>
> PhDs.
>
> But were you really surprised that, last year, 30,000 Google employees worked
>
> out to protest sexual harassment?
>
> Did you hear about this? This really happened? Because they were like, "Fuck,
>
> man. We can't take it anymore.
>
> It's like an orgy in there every day, all these horny PhDs," you know. But
>
> there is a simple solution to this.
>
> There's a simple answer. Now, I'm sensing a level of awkwardness already, but,
>
> you know, you guys kind of like Cedric,
>
> and I was even asking things to Cedric. It's going to get worse, because the
>
> solution to the problem is sex robots.
>
> Cedric, are you working on a sex robot? Do you have one at home?
>
> Not yet.
>
> Respect to this man. How long is it going to take? Every week you're away from
>
> your girlfriend, a little bit more sex bulk gets developed.
>
> Because, you know, think about it. If Google was to give, the solution is this.
>
> If Google was to give all their staff a sex bot,
>
> can you imagine what would happen? They could announce, you know, "We rolled
>
> out sex bots to all our staff,
>
> and sexual harassment has dropped an amazing 83 percent, and we're using sex
>
> bot analytics to track employee performance.
>
> Since we rolled out sex bots, our staff are more focused and productive."
>
> You know, and what you're seeing here is that sex bots are going to become
>
> mainstream.
>
> And then the big guys are going to get in, because they're going to be like, "Wow,
>
> this is a billion dollar market.
>
> You're going to have Apple." They're going to be like, "We brought you the iPod.
>
> We brought you the iPhone.
>
> Today we bring you the iFuck." And then Google is like, "Shit, we've got to
>
> move fast, man. We've got to move fast.
>
> Give them the Google ho." And then Amazon is like, "Shit, these guys are really
>
> moving fast. Take Alexa, take flying drones.
>
> Call it the flying fuck." You know, and these guys are really not on board with
>
> sex bots, man.
>
> What's happening here, you know, because it's an inevitability. Because, you
>
> know, you'll be, one day,
>
> you're like all the guys here, you know, where you have your own sex bot, and
>
> then you invite your friends around for beers, you know.
>
> And next morning, you've got to text your bro like, "Hey, man, last night, did
>
> you fuck my sex bot?"
>
> And he's like, "I know, man. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. She came on to me. I
>
> didn't mean to."
>
> And you're like, "Dude, you didn't even wash her out."
>
> Cedric, we're going to need sex bot security, you know, like swipe your dick to
>
> get in.
>
> But yeah, I don't know. I was telling this story to a friend of mine, a girl,
>
> and she was equally as shocked and perplexed as you guys are.
>
> Because, you know, she's like, "Are men really that bad? Are they really that
>
> horny?"
>
> And I said to her, "Well, you've heard of glory holes, right? Okay, now we're
>
> getting to somewhere really dark."
>
> Because sometimes I wonder, who the fuck came up with the name "glory hole,"
>
> you know? Was it a guy who had his dick in the wall, and he was just like, "This
>
> hole is glorious! Glorious hole!"
>
> No, I mean, this glorious... I mean, nowadays, wouldn't we call it a glory hole?
>
> We'd probably call it, like, a dick slit or a cock slot or maybe even a trunk
>
> dump.
>
> But the word "glory," who uses that nowadays, you know? Probably it was, like,
>
> in 1869, the famous British explorer Sir Richard Cogsworthy.
>
> He was in the darkest part of Africa. He found a hole, and he said, "I call
>
> this the glory hole," after my favorite niece, Gloria.
>
> And that's where it all began, you know? But, I mean, think about it, you know?
>
> If you want to understand male sexuality, how insane do you have to be to stick
>
> your dick through a wall?
>
> How insane do you have to be? Because there could be anything on the other side.
>
> There could be, like, a hungry wolf.
>
> There could be, like, a guillotine. There could be your grandmother. There
>
> could be anything, you know?
>
> Now, of course, of course, no man here would ever stick his dick in a glory
>
> hole. Except maybe Tim, you know? Because the streets of Manchester are full of
>
> glory, aren't they, Tim?
>
> They certainly are.
>
> I'm with you, Tim. But, you know, because none of you would do that, I know,
>
> unless...
>
> What if, what if you got abducted by the CIA and taken to a secret detention
>
> center, and they put you in a room, a room where you're all alone, with nothing
>
> but a glory hole?
>
> How long would it take, guys? Because, first of all, you'd be like, "Oh, no, I
>
> can't do this. No, I'm not, I'm not going to stick my dick in that hole. No way.
>
> It's not happening."
>
> But then, you know, time passes, time passes, and you'd be like, "Allah, Allah,
>
> give me strength. Give me strength. Inshallah, I will not put my dick in that
>
> hole."
>
> But eventually, it's like, "Oh, Jesus Christ, fuck it. All right, come on, I'll
>
> stick my dick in the hole."
>
> And that's where it goes downhill. But, you know, and I sense that this is a
>
> very awkward topic here, especially maybe for you, for the women here.
>
> This is probably a depressing thing to think about, that men are that stupid
>
> that they would put their dick in a glory hole.
>
> There is a bit of good news, because think about it. You're talking about a
>
> wall with a hole.
>
> If you're a little bit flat-chested, you're probably okay. You're probably okay.
>
> All that matters is the hole.
>
> All right, I'm leaving you guys there. You have been glorious. I love you guys.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it to the end.
