> Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it. We have made it.
>
> This is the last act of tonight.
>
> I know you guys are excited to meet this last comedian of tonight.
>
> So let's not waste any time.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, he is the sexiest comedian here in the Zurich comedy
>
> scene.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fuchs, everybody!
>
> Hey!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room of English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is
>
> Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> My family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call
>
> us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them "how-the" and "what-the".
>
> But, you know, the problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is people are always
>
> coming up to me and saying stupid shit.
>
> For example, recently, this American tourist came up to me and he's like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fuchs. Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> "So, Harry Fuchs what, man? Exactly. Harry Fuchs what?"
>
> I'm like, "Okay.
>
> Let me see if I can throw him off with some adverts."
>
> Uh, "Harry Fuchs, uh, hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fuchs occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> He's like, "No, man. No. Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens. Harry Fuchs
>
> tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of
>
> mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> Well, actually, I realized at that moment that actually there is a whole class
>
> of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like, like hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you may get up behind a hippo and think, "Mmm, that is a sweet ass."
>
> Don't do it. Hippos kill 500 people every year in Africa. They're the most
>
> dangerous mammal.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Well, elephants. Elephants, for example, you know, 'cause it's, it's so high up,
>
> you know.
>
> I mean, maybe Tim Comanche is like, "Yeah, I can do that."
>
> It's not true. It's not happening in, you know, but, but maybe, uh, maybe if
>
> the mum isn't looking, uh, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> All right, I'm just finding your level, 'cause I'm, I'm finding your level. You're
>
> okay with bestiality, but not pedophiles.
>
> I'll avoid that from now on because, you know, but I do have to confess, I, I
>
> do have a lot of dark thoughts going on in my head, you know, a lot of dark and
>
> twisted stuff, and I think it goes back to my childhood, you know, because I
>
> went to a Catholic school, and I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> And, uh, Tim.
>
> That's Tim from Manchester.
>
> Tim, welcome back. Tim! Tim!
>
> Tim knows what I'm talking about.
>
> But, actually, I'm not the only person with dark and twisted thoughts. You know
>
> who else has got a lot of fucked up shit going on in their head?
>
> PhD students. Seriously, PhD students. Like, take Cedric, for example.
>
> Like, Cedric, he's there, he's been working on his thesis all day, on his robot
>
> thesis, and he's like, it's three in the morning, he's been typing since 9am,
>
> three in the morning now.
>
> Like, he's tired, but he's got a head full of, like, equations and statistical
>
> models and, like, robot limbs and, you know, he's like, how am I going to get
>
> to sleep?
>
> I haven't even, you know, and then, and then he remembers, I haven't seen my
>
> girlfriend for, like, nine months, and Octav, he's on Pornhub.
>
> And then, you know, I mean, the average PhD, you've got to understand, it takes
>
> about eight years to complete.

> And what you're seeing here is that sex bots are going to become mainstream.

> And then the big guys are going to get in because they're going to be like, "Wow,
>
> this is a billion dollar market. You've got to have Apple."
>
> They're going to be like, "We brought you the iPod. We brought you the iPhone.
>
> Today we bring you the iFuck."
>
> And then Google is like, "Shit, we've got to move fast, man. We've got to move
>
> fast. Give them the Google Ho."
>
> And then Amazon is like, "Shit, these guys are really moving fast."
>
> And then Amazon is like, "Shit, these guys are really moving fast."
>
> "Take Alexa. Take flying drones. Call it a flying fuck."
>
> You know, and these guys are really not on board with sex bots, man.
>
> What's happening here, you know, because it's an inevitability.
>
> Because, you know, you'll be one day, you're like all the guys here, you know,
>
> where you have your own sex bot.
>
> And then you invite your friends around for beers, you know.
>
> And the next morning, you've got to text your bro like, "Hey, man, last night,
>
> did you fuck my sex bot?"
>
> And he's like, "I know, man. I'm sorry."
>
> And he's like, "I know, man. I'm sorry."
>

>
> "I'm really sorry. She came on to me. I didn't mean to."
>
> And you're like, "Dude, you didn't even wash her out."
>
> "Cedric, we're going to need sex bot security, you know. Like, swipe your dick
>
> to get in."
>
> But yeah, I don't know. I was telling this story.
>
> I was telling this story to a friend of mine, a girl.
>
> And she was equally as shocked and perplexed as you guys are.
>
> Because, you know, she's like,
>
> "Are men really that bad? Are they really that horny?"
>
> And I said to her,
>
> "Well, you've heard of glory holes, right?"
>
> Okay, now we're getting to somewhere really dark.
>
> Because sometimes I wonder, who the fuck came up with the name "glory hole"?
>
> You know, was it a guy who had his dick in the wall and he was just like,
>
> "This hole is glorious! Glorious hole!"
>
> No, I mean, this glorious...
>
> I mean, nowadays,
>
> wouldn't we call it a glory hole?
>
> We'd probably call it, like, a dick slit,
>
> or a cogs slot,
>
> or maybe even a trunk dump.
>
> The word "glory", who uses that nowadays, you know?
>
> Probably it was, like, in 1869,
>
> the famous British explorer, Sir Richard Coxworthy.
>
> He was in the darkest part of Africa.
>
> He found a hole, and he said,
>
> "I call this the glory hole."
>
> After my favorite niece, Gloria.
>
> And that's where it all began, you know?
>
> But, I mean, think about it.
>
> You know, if you want to understand male sexuality,
>
> how insane do you have to be to stick your dick through a wall?
>
> How insane do you have to be?
>
> Because there could be anything on the other side.
>
> There could be, like, a hungry wolf.
>
> There could be, like, a guillotine.
>
> There could be your grandmother.
>
> There could be anything, you know?
>
> Now, of course, of course, no man here
>
> would ever stick his dick in a glory hole.
>
> Except maybe Tim, you know?
>
> Because the streets of Manchester are full of glory, aren't they, Tim?
>
> They certainly are.
>
> I'm with you, Tim.
>
> But, you know, because none of you would do that, I know,
>
> unless, what if, what if you got abducted by the CIA
>
> and taken to a secret detention center,
>
> and put you in a room,
>
> a room where you're all alone,
>
> with nothing but a glory hole?
>
> How long would it take, guys?
>
> Because, first of all, you'd be like,
>
> "Oh, no, I can't do this. No, I'm not, I'm not going to stick my dick in that
>
> hole.
>
> No way. It's not happening."
>
> But then, you know, time passes, time passes,
>
> and you'd be like, "Allah, Allah, give me strength.
>
> Give me strength. Inshallah, I will not put my dick in that hole."
>
> But eventually, it's like, "Oh, Jesus Christ, fuck it."
>
> "All right, come on, I'll stick my dick in the hole."
>
> And that's where it goes downhill.
>
> But, you know, and I sense that this is a very awkward topic here,
>
> especially maybe for the women here.
>
> This is probably a depressing thing to think about,
>
> that men are that stupid that they would put their dick in a glory hole.
>
> There is a bit of good news, because think about it.
>
> You're talking about a wall with a hole.
>
> If you're a little bit flat-chested, you're probably okay.
>
> All that matters is the hole.
>
> All right, I'm leaving you guys there.
>
> You have been glorious.
>
> I love you guys. Thank you.
>
> You're going for Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> His name is Harry Fox. I'm his friend.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it to the end.
