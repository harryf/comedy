> That's that white privilege we've been talking about.
>
> That was hilarious, very nice.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we have one act left tonight.
>
> I know, oh my god, oh, it's over, it's almost over.
>
> We have one last act tonight, everybody,
>
> and this guy's very funny.
>
> He's originally from the UK, he's been living here
>
> four years, he's done our shows before.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise
>
> for your last act tonight, Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> - So my name is actually Harry Fooks.
>
> It's a German name, spelled F-O-O-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-O-O-C-K-S, but with English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of them think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> But my name is not Harry Fux.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Howler and Whatler.
>
> Yeah, it's tough, you know, and the problem, actually,
>
> with a name like Harry Fux is often people come up
>
> and they just say stupid shit.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up
>
> and he was like, "Yo, man, Harry Fux.
>
> "Harry Fux what, man?"
>
> I'm like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Harry Fux what, exactly?"
>
> I'm like, "Okay, let's see if we can throw him off
>
> "with some adverbs.
>
> "Harry Fux hopefully.
>
> "Harry Fux occasionally.
>
> "Harry Fux enthusiastically."
>
> That threw him off.
>
> He just melted down at that point.
>
> But, you know, honestly, the real thing about Harry Fux,
>
> it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> I've only really done about this much fucking.
>
> In fact, recently, it's been this much fucking.
>
> It's been a long time.
>
> And, you know, actually, put your hand up
>
> if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> - It's been a long time.
>
> - Okay, I hadn't realized I was coming
>
> to the Zurich nymphomaniacs and nuns theater.
>
> So, maybe to help you guys understand
>
> how it is when you haven't had sex for a long time,
>
> it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> 'Cause you could be like walking down the street
>
> and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses
>
> and you look at them and you're like,
>
> "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go up to a micro
>
> and you see an action on a watermelon.
>
> You know, one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bam, it's like you're in a different dimension.
>
> This is really a watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot, you've forgotten,
>
> people are watching you, it's getting steamy.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> "You're not sharing this information!"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady
>
> about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think she's nice.
>
> And that's how it is.
>
> But, you know, it actually gets worse
>
> because recently I started to wonder,
>
> am I even any good at sex?
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything,
>
> it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> Have you heard this?
>
> See, 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> I've thought about this, you know,
>
> because if you fuck for 24 hours a day
>
> for an entire year, you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to the age of 70,
>
> you have to fuck 10 times a day
>
> from the day you're born until the day you die.
>
> And I know what's worse about that,
>
> the idea of newborn babies fucking
>
> or the idea of sex with old people
>
> on the day they're dying.
>
> It's very dark.
>
> But, you know, I've been thinking about this a lot.
>
> And, you know, a while back,
>
> a long time ago as a teenager,
>
> what I realized is that the big problem
>
> is that men and women,
>
> we don't really understand what the opposite likes
>
> about sex.
>
> 'Cause a long time ago, I was on a date with this girl,
>
> and she could not even tell me
>
> where her own clitoris was.
>
> Can you believe that?
>
> She couldn't tell me.
>
> Now, it might have been 'cause I forgot to remove the gag.
>
> I can't remember.
>
> But, you know, you get the point.
>
> You get the point that it's tough.
>
> And I've been thinking about this a lot.
>
> And I think I found a simple solution
>
> for everyone living in Europe.
>
> All you have to do is take a number three tram
>
> through the city.
>
> If you take a number three tram,
>
> it's gonna stop at places that will blow your mind.
>
> Like, first of all, it's gonna stop outside Sensuel.
>
> Now, Sensuel is a sex shop for women.
>
> It's full of feathers and aromas
>
> and sexy underwear and erotic literature.
>
> Because for women, a lot about what makes sex enjoyable
>
> is what's happening in their head, in their head, you know?
>
> Which I think that means I need to put my dick in her mouth.
>
> Okay, I know that's an edgy joke.
>
> It's like, "Oh, God, I guess we gotta laugh at this one.
>
> "Thank you, thank you for making the effort.
>
> "Let's quickly get back on the tram through Zurich
>
> "and move on past."
>
> If you carry on through Zurich,
>
> eventually that tram is gonna stop outside another sex shop,
>
> a sex shop for men called the erotic factory.
>
> Because for men, nothing is more erotic than a factory.
>
> Full of underpaid workers, but in a first world country.
>
> And if you think about it, it's right there in the names.
>
> You know, like erotic factory men, Sensuel women.
>
> It's kind of never gonna work.
>
> But when I got thinking about this,
>
> maybe, maybe this is actually the key to our happiness.
>
> Because you could come to a place like this tonight
>
> and you see someone you like and you'd be like,
>
> "Hey, I feel you, yeah, I know.
>
> "I know you suck at sex.
>
> "So do I.
>
> "Let's have bad sex together."
>
> Should I carry on a bit, or should I just?
>
> So, all right, I do a little bit more.
>
> A little bit more.
>
> Just sort of tell more about myself.
>
> That's what we do here on stage.
>
> I'm also a single dad, and I have teenage kids.
>
> I have a teenage daughter.
>
> Being a father of a teenage daughter is hard,
>
> because I'm always being confronted with situations
>
> I'm just wholly unprepared for.
>
> Like recently, I came back from work,
>
> and went in the bathroom, and oh my God,
>
> it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was like a bloody hand print on the mirror,
>
> drops of blood in the sink, more blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around,
>
> and I realized that the screaming was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, my daughter showed up and said,
>
> "Hey, Dad, I got my period."
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> I was like, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> So I thought, okay, I'm completely unqualified
>
> for this job, but okay, it can't be so hard.
>
> So I went back to me, you know, wearing a wig,
>
> and I took a look around, and what I found
>
> is that tampon product names are no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because, you know, for example, there are names like OB Pro.
>
> What is this, like, for professional women
>
> that bleed for a living?
>
> Don't think I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or there's Tampax Radiance.
>
> What are we talking here, like, glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> For when the lights are off, you need to get it in?
>
> I don't know, I don't understand.
>
> But to me, the one I like the most,
>
> the one I could kind of connect with, too,
>
> is Always Infinity, for when your vagina
>
> is an unfitable black hole.
>
> But, you know, what I ended up doing, though,
>
> I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Promo 11, it's fantastic.
>
> Around about 10 o'clock, it starts leaking,
>
> and she is always promo by 11, it's amazing.
>
> And for me, the whole experience,
>
> it made me very proud as a father,
>
> because, honestly, it's not every day you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crowns in her vagina.
>
> Okay, I'm gonna leave you in that dark place.
>
> I know you've been super hot, I got a few weak laughs,
>
> but thanks for making that much effort.
>
> Have a good evening.
>
> - Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> - Bring it on.
