> That's that white privilege we've been talking about.
>
> That was hilarious. Very nice.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we have one act left tonight.
>
> I know, oh my god. Oh, it's over. It's almost over.
>
> We have one last act tonight, everybody.
>
> And this guy is very funny. He's originally from the UK.
>
> He's been living here four years. He's done our shows before.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for your last act tonight.
>
> Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halber and Wopper.
>
> Yeah, it's tough, you know.
>
> And the problem actually with a name like Harry Fuchs
>
> is often people come up and they just say stupid shit.
>
> Like recently this American tourist came up and he was like,
>
> Yo, man, Harry Fuchs! Harry Fuchs!
>
> What, man?
>
> And I'm like, what?
>
> He's like, Harry Fuchs what? Exactly!
>
> And I'm like, uh, okay, let's see if we can throw him off with some adverbs.
>
> Uh, Harry Fuchs, hopefully.
>
> Harry Fuchs, occasionally.
>
> Harry Fuchs, enthusiastically.
>
> That threw him off. He just, like, melted down at that point.
>
> But, you know, honestly, the real thing about Harry Fuchs is it sets a very
>
> high level of expectation.
>
> I've only really done about this much fucking.
>
> Like, recently, it's been this much fucking.
>
> It's been a long time.
>
> And, you know, actually, put your hand up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Okay. I hadn't realized I was coming to the Zurich Nymphomaniac Sonoma Theater.
>
> So maybe to help you guys understand how it is when you haven't had sex for a
>
> long time,
>
> it's kind of like...
>
> hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be, like, walking down the street and you see a couple of
>
> dogs
>
> sniffing each other's asses and you look at them and you're like,
>
> "I wish that was me!"
>
> Or you go over to a negro and you see an acción on watermelon.
>
> You know, one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bam! It's like you're in a different dimension.
>
> It's this watermelon, it's getting hot, you've forgotten people are watching
>
> you,
>
> it's getting steamy, and then you hear this,
>
> "Jungemann, schämen Sie sich nicht!"
>
> And you look, and there's an old lady about to hit you with that handbag.
>
> And you think she's nice.
>
> And that's how it is.
>
> But, you know, it actually gets worse because recently I started to wonder,
>
> "Am I even any good at sex?"
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything takes 10,000 hours.
>
> Have you heard this?
>
> See, 10,000 hours is a lot of work.
>
> It's a lot of fucking.
>
> I've thought about this, you know, because if you fuck for 24 hours a day for
>
> an entire year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to the age of 70, you have to fuck 10 times a day from the day you're
>
> born
>
> until the day you die.
>
> And I know what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking,
>
> or the idea of
>
> sex with old people on the day they're dying.
>
> It's very dark.
>
> But, you know, I've been thinking about this a lot.
>
> And, you know, a while back, a long time ago, as we've ascertained here,
>
> what I realized is that the big problem is that men and women,
>
> we don't really understand what the opposite likes about sex.
>
> Because a long time ago, I was on a date with this girl,
>
> and she could not even tell me where her own clitoris was.
>
> Can you believe that?
>
> She couldn't tell me.
>
> That might have been because I forgot to remove the gag.
>
> I can't remember.
>
> But, you know, you get the point.
>
> You get the point that it's tough.
>
> And I've been thinking about this a lot.
>
> And I think I've found a simple solution for everyone living in Europe.
>
> All you have to do is take a number three tram through the city.
>
> If you take a number three tram, it's going to stop at places that will blow
>
> your mind.
>
> Like, first of all, it's going to stop outside Sensuel.
>
> Now, Sensuel is a sex shop for women.
>
> It's full of feathers and aromas and sexy underwear and erotic literature.
>
> Because for women, a lot about what makes sex enjoyable is what's happening in
>
> their head.
>
> In their head, you know.
>
> Which I think that means I need to put my dick in her mouth.
>
> Okay, so I know it's an edgy joke because I thought, oh god, I guess we're
>
> gonna laugh.
>
> We're gonna laugh at this one.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you for making the effort.
>
> Let's quickly get back on the tram through Zurich and move on past.
>
> If you carry on through Zurich, eventually that tram is going to stop outside
>
> another sex shop.
>
> A sex shop for men called the Erotic Factory.
>
> Because for men, nothing is more erotic than a factory.
>
> Full of underpaid workers.
>
> But in the first world, come on.
>
> We're a country, you know.
>
> And if you think about it, it's right there in the names, you know.
>
> Like erotic factory men, sensual women.
>
> It's kind of never going to work.
>
> But what I got thinking about this, maybe, maybe this is actually the key to
>
> our happiness.
>
> Because, you know, you could come to a place like this tonight and you see
>
> someone you like
>
> and you'd be like, hey, I feel you.
>
> Yeah, I know.
>
> I know you suck at sex.
>
> So do I.
>
> Let's have bad sex together.
>
> Should I carry on a bit, or should I just...
>
> So, all right, I do a little bit more.
>
> A little bit more.
>
> Just to tell more about myself.
>
> That's what we do here on stage.
>
> I'm also a single dad and I have teenage kids.
>
> I have a teenage daughter.
>
> Being a father of a teenage daughter is hard because I'm always being
>
> confronted with
>
> situations I'm just wholly unprepared for.
>
> Like recently, I came back from work and went
>
> in the bathroom and, oh my God, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was like a bloody handprint on the mirror, drops of blood in the sink,
>
> more blood on
>
> the floor, and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming.
>
> And I looked around and I realized that the screaming was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, my daughter showed up and said, hey, dad, I got my period.
>
> So after cleaning, I went to the bathroom.
>
> I was cleaning up that menstrual blood.
>
> I was like, hey, can I get you something?
>
> And she said, dad, get me tampons.
>
> So I thought, okay, I'm completely unqualified for this job, but okay, it can't
>
> be so hard.
>
> So I went back to Migros wearing a wig and I took a look around and what I
>
> found is that
>
> tampon product names are no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because, you know, for example, there are names like OB Pro, because it's like
>
> foot
>
> professional women that bleed for a living.
>
> I don't think I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or there's Tampax Radiance.
>
> What are we talking here?
>
> Like glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> For when the lights are off, you need to get it in?
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't understand.
>
> But to me, the one I like the most, the one I could kind of connect with to is
>
> always
>
> infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfittable black hole.
>
> But, you know, what I ended up doing though, I ended
>
> up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It's fantastic.
>
> Around about 10 o'clock it starts leaking and she is always home by eleven.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> And for me, for me, the whole experience, it made me very proud as a father,
>
> because
>
> honestly, it's not every day you get to choose what your daughter crowns in her
>
> vagina.
>
> Okay, I'm going to leave you in that dark place.
>
> I know you've been super hot.
>
> Yeah, I've got a few wee gloves, but thanks for making that much effort.
>
> Have a good evening.
>
> Give it up for Harry Foster, everybody!
>
> Give it up.
>
> Wow.
