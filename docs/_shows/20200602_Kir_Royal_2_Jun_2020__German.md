<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Originally he came to Zurich at the age of 18 and he has the best name in the world.
>
> A big round of applause for Harry Fuchs!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> That's a German name.
>
> I sometimes write F-Ü-CKS. I repeat, F-Ü-CKS.
>
> But when I grew up in England, many believed that my name was Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family, when we meet, we would be very annoyed if someone called us a group of fuckers.
>
> I have two children, and to give them a good start, I had to call them Halber and Wopper.
>
> Just like that.
>
> Thank you. So one of them got it.
>
> The rest are just shocked, but I'll do the rest.
>
> No, the real problem with names like Harry Fuchs is that in my life there have been far too few
>
> fucking Fuchs.
>
> Can you say F-Ü-CKS? I don't know. I was born in England.
>
> And if I may share that, because of the whole Corona lockdown, I didn't have sex at all.
>
> Hands up if you didn't have sex at all in the last time.
>
> Wow. Okay.
>
> I didn't know that I would come to the Zurich nymphomaniac track.
>
> Okay, so that you can understand me.
>
> If you haven't had sex for a long time, it's as if you hallucinate.
>
> For example, when you're on the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing at each other's asses.
>
> And you think, "I'd like to do that too."
>
> Or you go to the micro. You go to the micro, you get one hand on the watermelon.
>
> Maybe two. Boom! It's as if you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's getting warm, it's getting hot, it doesn't matter who's watching.
>
> And then suddenly you hear, "Young man, are you ashamed?"
>
> "That's an old woman. She wants to hit you with her handkerchief."
>
> And you think, "Very nice."
>
> Yes, that's how it is when you haven't had sex for a long time.
>
> And when you see the lockdown, "My stupid suitcase came up with a really stupid idea."
>
> "I opened a Tinder profile."
>
> Okay, for you, you're all relatively young.
>
> Tinder is still a great place, because you can swipe hot bodies and possible erotic encounters.
>
> It's your thing. Your perfect match is somewhere in there.
>
> But for me, I have to use old Tinder.
>
> And old Tinder is a dark word.
>
> Because I have to swipe broken marriages.
>
> Swipe drugs and alcohol problems.
>
> Broken tattoos that say, "No regrets!"
>
> It's dark.
>
> I ask myself, "Ladies, what happens in the next 10 to 15 years that breaks your life?"
>
> Because the worst thing on old Tinder is the sight of a 50-year-old woman who makes a duck face.
>
> So how do you get to 50 years where you think the duck face is still okay?
>
> The only time the duck face is okay is when both parents are ducks.
>
> And ducks only live 10 years.
>
> So the universe doesn't make room for a 50-year-old duck face.
>
> And what's even worse, but it's even darker, is swiping when you go on a real old Tinder date.
>
> And you go there and think, "Yeah, okay, I'm full of courage and joy."
>
> And then suddenly the conversation changes.
>
> "Yeah, okay, I fucked up my life for the last 40 years."
>
> "But somehow I'm still optimistic that it's going to get better from now on."
>
> And then she says, "Wow, yes, I also completely ruined my life."
>
> Then you think, "Wow, we have something in common."
>
> Which is completely depressing.
>
> You want to come to me and then we can just kill each other.
>
> That would be the complete end of this world, I think.
>
> Yes, and afterwards I thought, "This article is complete shit, I'll delete it."
>
> And just as I was about to delete it, I got another message.
>
> It was from a lady, I think she was 52 years old.
>
> She said, "With those beautiful blue eyes, why are you still free here?"
>
> "Besides, this is the most stupid animation I've ever heard."
>
> "Imagine, I would tell this to any woman here in our room."
>
> "You shouldn't be walking around here free."
>
> "You should be stuck in my cave."
>
> "It's completely crazy."
>
> "You shouldn't tell anyone."
>
> And then it became clear to me, older women have a bit of a problem.
>
> They don't know how to handle men.
>
> In English they say, "They have zero game."
>
> And what's worse, I recently read that as women get older, their lust increases.
>
> All these years, men have been given all the training.
>
> Now men are aware of how to handle men.
>
> And then I thought, "Wait a minute, this is really bad."
>
> So that means they have zero game.
>
> They are super awesome, and nobody wants to sleep with them.
>
> It's bad, I know.
>
> And I thought, it was so bad, I thought, "I can solve this."
>
> "I'll find a solution."
>
> "We just need one more group that has zero game."
>
> "Is super awesome, and doesn't want to fuck anyone."
>
> "Teenage Jules."
>
> "That's the perfect match."
>
> And I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> So I just invented a app, it's called "Teender."
>
> Yeah, okay.
>
> It's similar, it's just a bit younger.
>
> It's similar to the social media app.
>
> But I think it actually comes from my childhood.
>
> Because when I was seven, something was taken from me.
>
> Exactly, I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, according to this reaction, most people don't understand what circumcision is.
>
> We can talk about it later.
>
> But what started as a very traumatic childhood.
>
> As an adult, it has become quite an advantage.
>
> Because even the rare moments when a woman finds her head next to my penis.
>
> When she is always so silent, like...
>
> And I would say, "Hey, why are you staring at my penis?"
>
> And she would say, "You have no idea how many dirty asses there are out there."
>
> Yeah, so he laughs a lot.
>
> I don't know why.
>
> He probably saw a lot.
>
> And what I understood is that actually as my uncut brother.
>
> I have far too little attention in this area.
>
> And that's why I end with a few tips that can help you.
>
> To make your partner so happy.
>
> For example, you know in the car.
>
> You have this on the mirror, this wonderful pendant.
>
> Just hang it from your penis.
>
> So women are very generous.
>
> That will make them happy right away.
>
> And just hang it from your penis.
>
> You can just tattoo a beautiful tooth.
>
> For example, a fern of green grass.
>
> With flowers or flowers.
>
> Come on, with a couple of birds.
>
> That would be beautiful, wouldn't it?
>
> But there is an easier way.
>
> I don't believe in all this.
>
> There is a completely easier way.
>
> You just bring a package of onion knots.
>
> And when you're down there, you can just wrap it with onion.
>
> Because cheese really goes well with onion.
>
> Oh, that's nice.
>
> You know, I do it because what it means.
>
> Tonight no one gets sex here.
>
> And now we're all in one room together.
>
> Okay, thank you.
