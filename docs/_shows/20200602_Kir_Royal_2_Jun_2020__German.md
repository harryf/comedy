<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Originally he was born in Zurich at the age of 18 and he has the best name in
>
> the world.
>
> A big round of applause for Harry Fux!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Sometimes I write F-U-C-K-S, I repeat F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I grew up in England, many people think that my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux.
>
> With my family, when we meet, we get very annoyed when someone calls us a group
>
> of fuckers.
>
> And I have two children.
>
> They are good friends.
>
> To start, they had to say "how the and what the name is".
>
> Just like that.
>
> Thank you.
>
> So one had to start.
>
> The rest are just shocked.
>
> But I do the rest of the show.
>
> The real problem with a name like Harry Fux is that in my life there are far
>
> too few fuckers.
>
> Can you say fucker? I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know if you can understand me, how it is when you haven't had sex for a
>
> long time. It's like you're hallucinating.
>
> For example, you walk down the street, see a few dogs, they pinch their asses,
>
> and you think, "I'd like to be there too."
>
> Or you go to the toilet, and you get one hand on the watermelon, maybe two, BOOM!
>
> It's like you're in a new dimension. It gets hot, it gets hot, it doesn't
>
> matter who looks at you.
>
> And then suddenly you hear: "Young man, are you ashamed?"
>
> That's an old woman, she wants to hit you with her handkerchief, and you think,
>
> "Very nice."
>
> Yes, that's how it is when you haven't had sex for a long time.
>
> And when the lockdown comes, it's like, "Oh, my God!"
>
> And when the lockdown comes, it's like, "Oh, my God!"
>
> And when the lockdown comes, it's like, "Oh, my God!"
>
> And when the lockdown comes, it's like, "Oh, my God!"
>
> And when the lockdown comes, it's like, "Oh, my God!"
>
> In the lockdown, my stupid head has come up with a very stupid idea. I opened a
>
> Tinder profile.
>
> Okay, for you, you are all relatively young. Tinder is still a great place
>
> because you can swipe through hot bodies and possible erotic opponents.
>
> And the town is your prince. Your perfect match is somewhere in there.
>
> But for me, I have to use old Tinder. And old Tinder is a dark place.
>
> Because I have to swipe broken marriages, swipe drugs and alcohol problems,
>
> blow off tattoos that say "No Regrets".
>
> It's dark.
>
> And you know, I ask myself, ladies, what's going to happen in the next 10 to 15
>
> years that will make women dead?
>
> Because the worst thing about old Tinder is the sight of a 50-year-old woman
>
> who makes a dog face.
>
> So how do you get to 50 years where you think that dog faces are always there?
>
> The only time the dog face is okay is when both parents are ducks.
>
> And ducks only live for 10 years.
>
> So the universe doesn't have room for a 50-year-old dog face.
>
> Yes, and what's even worse, but it's even darker,
>
> than all the swiping is when you go on a real old Tinder.
>
> A date-gate.
>
> And then you go there and think, "Yes, okay, I'm full of courage and joy."
>
> And then all of a sudden, the swiping stops.
>
> "Yes, okay, I've spent the last 40 years of my life, but somehow I'm still
>
> optimistic that it will get better from now on."
>
> And then she says, "Wow, yes, I've also completely destroyed my life."
>
> Then you think, "Wow, we have something in common."
>
> Which is completely depressing.
>
> You want to come to me, and then we can just switch worlds.
>
> That would be the perfect end of this world, I think.
>
> And then afterwards I thought, "This app is completely shit. I'll delete it."
>
> And just as I was deleting it, I got another message.
>
> It was from a lady, I think she was 52.
>
> She said, "So with these beautiful brown eyes,
>
> why are you still walking around freely?"
>
> So, apart from that, this is the most stupid thing I've ever heard.
>
> Imagine, I want to tell this to any woman around here.
>
> You shouldn't be walking around freely.
>
> You should be locked up in my cave.
>
> It's completely crazy.
>
> You shouldn't be showing this to anyone.
>
> And then it became clear to me.
>
> So, older women have a bit of a problem.
>
> They don't know how to dress up as men.
>
> In English, they say, "They have zero game."
>
> And what's even worse, I've recently read,
>
> as women get older, their lust increases.
>
> So, all these years, men have received all the exercises.
>
> Now, these men know how to dress up with this age.
>
> And then I thought, "Wait a minute, this is really bad."
>
> So, that means then, they have zero game.
>
> They are super cool.
>
> And no one wants to sleep with the wild one.
>
> It's bad.
>
> And I thought, it was so bad, I thought,
>
> I can solve this.
>
> I think there is a solution to this.
>
> We just need another group that has zero game.
>
> It's super cool.
>
> And no one wants to fuck with it.
>
> Teenage boys.
>
> This is the perfect match.
>
> And I'm a bit entrepreneurial.
>
> So, I'm developing an app right now.
>
> It's called Teender.
>
> Yeah, okay.
>
> It's similar.
>
> It's always a bit dark.
>
> It's similar to a social button tip.
>
> But I think it actually comes from my childhood.
>
> Because when I was seven,
>
> something was taken away from me.
>
> Exactly.
>
> I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, according to this reaction,
>
> most people don't understand what circumcision is.
>
> We can talk about it later.
>
> But yeah, what started as a very traumatic childhood,
>
> as an adult, has become a real advantage.
>
> Because even those rare moments,
>
> when a woman finds a penis next to my head,
>
> it has always been so quiet.
>
> Like...
>
> And I was like,
>
> "Hey, why are you standing on my penis?"
>
> And she was like,
>
> "You have no idea how many dirty pimples there are out there."
>
> Yeah, so he laughs a lot.
>
> I don't know why.
>
> He's probably seen a lot.
>
> But what I understood is,
>
> that actually, as my uncut brother,
>
> I had far too little,
>
> so I had to pay a lot of attention to that.
>
> And that's why I ended up with a few tips
>
> that can help you make your partner so happy.
>
> Because, for example,
>
> you know in the car,
>
> you have this,
>
> hanging on the mirror,
>
> this beautiful tree.
>
> Just hang it on your penis.
>
> So, women are very big-minded.
>
> That will make them happy right away.
>
> Or just like up here,
>
> on top of your penis,
>
> you can just tattoo a beautiful tooth.
>
> So, for example,
>
> a plant of green grass,
>
> with flowers,
>
> or maybe a tree
>
> with a few birds in it.
>
> That would be beautiful, right?
>
> But there is a simple solution.
>
> I don't think there's anything like that.
>
> There is a completely simple solution.
>
> You just bring a pack of onions with you.
>
> And when it's down there,
>
> you can just put onions on it.
>
> Because cheese really goes well with onions.
>
> Oh, that's my girl.
>
> You know,
>
> I don't know what that means.
>
> No one is having sex here tonight.
>
> And now we're all in one room together.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Okay, thank you.
