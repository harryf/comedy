> I'll bring up this next guy.
>
> Uh, he's, uh, he's very funny.
>
> He's been living here since he was a British guy.
>
> He's living here since he was a British guy.
>
> And, uh, and this is his real name.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.
>
> It's Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Books.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them housewives.
>
> Mother and what-the.
>
> Just to give them a good start in life.
>
> But, uh, honestly, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is, uh,
>
> there just hasn't been enough fucking.
>
> In fact, uh, recently, it's been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Yeah.
>
> Yes, thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> I mean, I would say obviously, but, uh...
>
> I'm funny, I have this, we share the same issues.
>
> No, uh, but for the rest of you, I'm a bit disappointed
>
> that you haven't been respecting the social distancing guidelines.
>
> I didn't realize that I'm coming here tonight
>
> for the Zurich Nymphomaniacs Anonymous.
>
> So maybe, uh, so I can explain our condition here,
>
> how it is when...
>
> when you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> It's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street,
>
> you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses,
>
> and you just think, I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into Migros,
>
> you go into Migros and you spot an axion on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon,
>
> maybe two,
>
> and bam, it's like you're in a...
>
> a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot, it's getting steamy,
>
> you don't care about all the people looking.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> you're the man's shaman, ZZ.
>
> And you look and there's an old lady
>
> about to hit you with a handbag,
>
> and you think, she's nice.
>
> Yeah, so that's...
>
> that's how that's been going.
>
> Um, yeah, I don't know, this whole COVID thing,
>
> a lot of people have been very bored.
>
> I know not you guys, you've been too busy having sex,
>
> but...
>
> but me, I wasn't bored
>
> because I did important work during lockdown.
>
> I explored one of the universe's greatest mysteries.
>
> Of course, I'm talking about lesbians.
>
> Now, I think that lesbians don't get enough attention,
>
> and obviously, who better to speak for lesbians
>
> than a middle-aged bald guy from England?
>
> Do we have any lesbians here tonight?
>
> Okay, lesbians.
>
> I'm a ninja, so you can never see them.
>
> They're just, uh, hiding places.
>
> So, well, I did some research on lesbians,
>
> and one thing I learned is that only 1.1% of women
>
> identify as lesbian,
>
> which to me seems like a surprisingly low number.
>
> I would have expected more
>
> because of what else would explain
>
> the most boring prison series ever,
>
> Orange is the New Black.
>
> And, in fact, you know, I got thinking about it,
>
> and I'm pretty sure that every woman has had that moment
>
> where she's just lying on her back daydreaming
>
> while some guy is down here just fiddling around
>
> and getting it all wrong.
>
> She thought, maybe it's time to be a lesbian.
>
> Okay, I'm sensing some identification
>
> when it's still at the, uh, the hidden libel.
>
> Okay, maybe there's some couples discussions there.
>
> But I think one of the things that I find is a bit strange is,
>
> I wonder if lesbians are really happy
>
> being bundled in there with LGBT.
>
> Because the G's and the B's and the T's,
>
> they, their favorite hobby is ass-fucking.
>
> And lesbians, you know,
>
> lesbians, they would rather, like, hold hands and, you know,
>
> go for a walk in the nature, drink some lemon tea.
>
> It seems like an odd collection of people.
>
> You have, like, an LGBT meet-up and all the G, B's,
>
> and T's are discussing what lube to buy.
>
> And the lesbians are just in the corner doing some knitting.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know if I'm getting the right lesbian stereotypes here.
>
> In fact, I don't want to shame any women here
>
> that are considering as a result of your relationship
>
> becoming a lesbian.
>
> But, uh, you know, I, like,
>
> I really don't want to end up in a situation
>
> where I'm being chased down the street
>
> by a horde of rampaging lesbians
>
> who just want to, you know,
>
> just want to kill me.
>
> Although that is surprisingly not a very scary thought.
>
> In fact, I probably wouldn't run that fast
>
> and I might just, you know...
>
> Oh, uh, please, please don't hurt me.
>
> I think, uh...
>
> Okay, so that's...
>
> That was my, uh, lesbians in lockdown set
>
> and I've got nothing more than that.
>
> Thank you.
>
> As you can see, lockdown did me no good whatsoever.
>
> That's it.
>
> That was Harry Pops, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Definitely living up to his name.
>
> Uh, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Let's, uh, we have one last comment.
>
> Yes.
>
> You're up.
>
> What do I do?
>
> Um, I didn't...
>
> I, I called you.
