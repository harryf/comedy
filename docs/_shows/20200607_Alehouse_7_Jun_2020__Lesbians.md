> I'm going to bring up this next guy.
>
> Uh, he's, uh, he's very funny.
>
> He's been living here in Switzerland.
>
> He's a British guy living here in Switzerland.
>
> And, uh, and this is his real name.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.
>
> It's Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen. Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Books.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F. U. C. K. S.
>
> I repeat, F. U.
>
> C. K. S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers
>
> like this one, what do you think?
>
> My name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family,
>
> when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us
>
> a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them
>
> Halba and Watba.
>
> But, uh, honestly,
>
> the real problem with a name like
>
> Harry Fox is, uh,
>
> there just hasn't been enough fucking.
>
> In fact, uh,
>
> recently, it's been a long time
>
> since I've had sex. Put your hands up
>
> if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Yes, thank you.
>
> I mean, I would say obviously.
>
> We share the same issues.
>
> No, uh, but for the rest of you,
>
> I'm a bit disappointed that you haven't
>
> been respecting the social distancing
>
> guidelines. I didn't realize
>
> that I'm coming here tonight for the
>
> Nymphomaniacs Anonymous.
>
> So maybe, uh, so I can explain
>
> our condition here, how it is
>
> when you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> It's kind of like you're
>
> hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street,
>
> you see a couple of dogs
>
> sniffing each other's
>
> asses, and you just
>
> think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros.
>
> You go into Migros and you spot
>
> an acción on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon,
>
> maybe two,
>
> BAM! It's like you're in a new
>
> dimension. It's just you
>
> and that watermelon, it's getting hot,
>
> it's getting steamy, you don't care about
>
> what people are looking. And then you hear this,
>
> "Younger man shamans, is it?"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about
>
> to hit you with a handbag, and you think,
>
> "She's nice."
>
> Yeah, so that's
>
> how that's been going.
>
> Yeah, I don't know, this whole COVID thing,
>
> a lot of people have been very bored.
>
> I know not you guys, you've been too busy
>
> having sex.
>
> But me, I wasn't bored
>
> because I did important
>
> work during lockdown.
>
> I explored one of the
>
> universe's greatest mysteries.
>
> Of course, I'm talking
>
> about lesbians.
>
> Now, I think that lesbians
>
> don't get enough attention, and
>
> obviously, who better
>
> to speak for lesbians than a middle-aged
>
> bald guy from New York?
>
> Do we have any lesbians here tonight?
>
> Okay, lesbians are like
>
> ninjas, you can never see them,
>
> they're just hiding places.
>
> So, well, I did some research
>
> on lesbians, and one thing I learned
>
> is that only 1.1%
>
> of women
>
> identify as lesbian.
>
> Which, to me, seems like a surprisingly
>
> low number. I would have
>
> expected more because of what else
>
> would explain the most
>
> boring prison series ever,
>
> "Orange is the New Black."
>
> And, in fact,
>
> I got thinking about it, and I'm pretty
>
> sure that every woman has had
>
> that moment where she's just
>
> lying on her back daydreaming
>
> while some guy is down here
>
> just fiddling around and getting
>
> all wrong. She thought,
>
> "Maybe it's time to be a lesbian."
>
> Okay, I'm sensing some
>
> identification, but it's still
>
> at the hidden level.
>
> Okay, maybe there's some couples discussions.
>
> I think one of the things that I find
>
> is a bit strange is, I wonder
>
> if lesbians are really happy
>
> being bundled in there
>
> with LGBT.
>
> Because the G's and the
>
> B's and the T's,
>
> their favorite hobby
>
> is ass fucking.
>
> And lesbians, you know,
>
> lesbians, they would rather
>
> hold hands and, you know,
>
> go for a walk in the nature, drink some
>
> lemon tea. It seems like an odd collection
>
> of people. You have, like, an
>
> LGBT meet-up, and
>
> all the G, B's, and T's
>
> are discussing what lube to buy,
>
> and the lesbians are just in the corner
>
> doing some knitting. I don't know.
>
> I don't know if I'm getting the right lesbian
>
> stereotype here.
>
> In fact, I don't want to shame any
>
> women here that are considering, as a
>
> result of your relationship, becoming
>
> a lesbian. [laughter]
>
> But, you know, I really
>
> don't want to end up in a situation
>
> where I'm being chased down the street
>
> by a horde of rampaging
>
> lesbians who just want to kill me.
>
> Although that is surprisingly
>
> not a very scary thought.
>
> In fact, I probably
>
> wouldn't run that fast, and I might
>
> just, you know... [laughter]
>
> Oh, please, please, don't
>
> hurt me. I think...
>
> Okay, so that's... that was
>
> my lesbians
>
> in lockdown set, and I've
>
> got nothing more than that. Thank you. As you can
>
> see, lockdown did me no
>
> good whatsoever. [laughter]
>
> This is Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> He's living up to his name.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen.
>
> We have one last...
