> I'm actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name, but I'm in a lot of English
>
> speakers like this, you all seem to think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's not Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group of fuckers.
>
> We're just a pack of fucks.
>
> But I have two kids, I call them Halder and Wadda.
>
> I wanted to give them a good start to life.
>
> Yeah, but sometimes, actually recently, this American tourist came up to me and
>
> he said,
>
> Yo man, what's up? Harry Fuchs, man. Harry Fuchs what?
>
> I'm like, what?
>
> He's like, Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> So I thought I'd try and throw him off with a few adverbs.
>
> I'm like, Harry Fuchs hopefully.
>
> Harry Fuchs occasionally.
>
> Harry Fuchs intentionally.
>
> He's like, no, man, no, like Harry Fuchs goats, man, Harry Fuchs chickens,
>
> Harry Fuchs tigers.
>
> I'm like, well, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure in the whole
>
> history of mankind, no one has successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> Maybe people got fucked by a tiger.
>
> But, you know, and it made me realize there's actually a whole category of
>
> animals that you just can't fuck.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> You may get behind a hippo and think, wow, that is a sweet ass.
>
> Just kind of slide in there.
>
> Hippos will fuck you up, though.
>
> They are the most dangerous mammal in Africa.
>
> They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> So don't fuck with hippos.
>
> Also elephants, you know, because think about it.
>
> It's just too high up.
>
> I don't care, like, how big you claim to be.
>
> It's just not going to reach.
>
> And those elephants are pretty aggressive, so they also fuck you up.
>
> But maybe if the mom's not watching, you could fuck a baby elephant.
>
> I'm just finding your level, okay, sir.
>
> And see, it's clear you're very comfortable with bestiality, but I'm sure about
>
> pedophiles.
>
> All right, well, it's a dark night, and the jokes are dark.
>
> And, you know...
>
> Because I have a lot of dark and twisted thoughts going on in my head.
>
> And I think it goes back to my childhood, because I went to a Catholic school.
>
> But I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> But I think, actually, this was a significant moment in the history of mankind,
>
> because this is the answer.
>
> The answer is, every time we hear about a priest molesting a child, we've got
>
> to hit back, man.
>
> We've got to get back to vigilante justice.
>
> Go out, molest a priest right now.
>
> It's going to solve this problem in less than one week.
>
> We need vigilantes like, I don't know, Buttman and Rapin.
>
> I don't know, she doesn't like raping other priests.
>
> So, you know, this is how it's going to work.
>
> Okay, we're losing some of these...
>
> This corner's gone very quiet.
>
> Sex in the city.
>
> These guys are down.
>
> They're taking out priests tonight.
>
> You know, but, I don't know, it's for me, these days it's actually very tough
>
> being a guy,
>
> because, you know, in the history of mankind, all the bad shit's been done by
>
> men.
>
> And these days, society doesn't think a lot of good things about men, you know.
>
> It's tough to get over that.
>
> Recently, for example, I was on a tram.
>
> I saw this couple, and there's a guy kissing a girl.
>
> And then I noticed that the girl had Down syndrome.
>
> And I thought...
>
> Now, think about this for a second.
>
> If that had been a girl, and the guy had Down syndrome, and you'd seen them on
>
> the tram,
>
> you'd imagine this, you would...
>
> Personally, I would just think, wow, what an amazing person she is.
>
> She is, like, so caring, so giving, that she would go through all of that and
>
> have a boyfriend with Down syndrome.
>
> What a wonderful person that she could love.
>
> But I saw this guy, and I'm just like, motherfucker.
>
> Because people with Down syndrome...
>
> You may not know this, they're very affectionate, and also, you know, it does
>
> cross into, like, sexual behavior.
>
> And this guy is basically tacked into the source of unlimited free sex.
>
> And, you know, and I just got thinking, like, this guy is a sick asshole, you
>
> know.
>
> He's probably got some games, like, he says to her, "Hey, honey, time for the
>
> lollipop game."
>
> Or, you know, "Let's play hide the rabbit."
>
