>
> I'm wholly unprepared for you know
>
> like recently I came back from work
>
> I went into the bathroom and oh my god
>
> it looked like a crime scene
>
> there was a bloody handprint on the mirror
>
> drops of blood in there
>
> in the sink
>
> more blood on the floor
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie
>
> and then I heard a screaming
>
> and I looked around
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me
>
> and at that moment my daughter showed up and said
>
> hey dad I got my period
>
> so after cleaning up her menstrual blood
>
> because I've got to do that
>
> if she does it she's just going to smear it around her

> and I was like this can't be so hard
>
> I went over to Miglo
>
> I took a look around and what I discovered is that
>
> tampon product names are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon
>
> because you've got names like OB Pro
>
> what is that?
>
> is that like for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> that doesn't seem like something I want for my daughter
>
> I don't know
>
> or Tampax Radiance
>
> like what is that?
>
> like glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> like no idea about that
>
> the one I like the most is called Always Infinity
>
> because that's for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole
>
> but I ended up in the end choosing another product from Always
>
> this product is fantastic
>
> it's called Always Home by Eleven
>
> wow
>
> because round about 10 o'clock it starts to leak
>
> and she is always home by eleven
>
> it's fantastic
>
> you know this whole experience
>
> it was actually for me a very proud one as a father
>
> because honestly I don't know
>
> honestly it's not every day
>
> that you get to choose what your daughter crowns in her vagina
>
> alright I think I'm done
>
> I'm just going to leave
>
> without opening my eyes
>
> please give it up for Harry
>
> yes!
