> Let's see what we've got next.
>
> Oh, you guys are in for a treat.
>
> The next comedian, I actually met him when I first got back into comedy in Switzerland.
>
> And he's been a big inspiration for me.
>
> He's a really great guy.
>
> Please give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fooks.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelt F-O-O-C-K-S. I repeat, F-O-O-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halver and Walther.
>
> I just didn't have a good start in life.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is there just hasn't been enough fucking, honestly.
>
> And I think the reason for that is I'm actually a single dad.
>
> I have two teenage kids.
>
> Have we got any parents here tonight?
>
> Wow, wow. Parents gone wild tonight.
>
> Wow, they've got a babysitter.
>
> They're trying to rekindle their love life tonight.
>
> That is fantastic.
>
> I salute you.
>
> But, you know, for me the problem is there's, like, teenage kids.
>
> Like, living in a flat with teenage kids is like living in a video game.
>
> Because there's never any milk.
>
> Like, it's always a fucking mess.
>
> And the worst is I have to pay for everything.
>
> The shittest flat chair ever.
>
> And my teenage son, you know, he's a bit of a gamer.
>
> He plays a lot of Grand Theft Auto.
>
> Now, some of you may be thinking, like, you shouldn't be letting him play Grand Theft Auto.
>
> It's that game where he gets to beat up hookers and stuff like this.
>
> But I think actually Grand Theft Auto is teaching him some important life skills.
>
> Like, he's learned to sit in a chair for eight hours without eating, talking, or going to the
>
> toilet.
>
> Which is clearly perfect preparation for future office life.
>
> And his English skills, he plays online, he plays against American.
>
> His English skills have improved dramatically.
>
> He's learned some key phrases like, "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> "I'll piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> Makes me very proud.
>
> But, you know, actually something bad happened recently.
>
> Because recently, I caught him looking at porn.
>
> Luckily, I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> I could point him at all the experts.
>
> And we came to a bit of an agreement.
>
> So right now, at his age, he's getting, like, boobs and butts and blowjobs.
>
> You know, just the good, wholesome porn.
>
> And for his birthday, he's getting lesbians.
>
> Because, man, we need something to fantasize about that we will never see in our life.
>
> Any lesbians here tonight?
>
> Okay, they're like ninjas. You never see them.
>
> Yeah, but also, I have a teenage daughter.
>
> Wow, now that is tough for me as a single dad.
>
> Because I'm constantly being confronted with situations I'm wholly unprepared for, you know?
>
> Like, recently, I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom and, oh my god, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror.
>
> Drops of blood in the sink.
>
> More blood on the floor.
>
> And the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming.
>
> And I looked around.
>
> And I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> And at that moment, my daughter showed up and said,
>
> "Hey, Dad, I got my period!"
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> because I've got to do that.
>
> If she does it, she's just going to smear it around.
>
> After clearing up her menstrual blood,
>
> the horror of that moment just came back to me.
>
> So I said to her, "Hey, daughter, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, obviously, as a man, this is a job that I have zero qualifications for.
>
> But I thought, hey, like a naive idiot,
>
> I thought, hey, this can't be so hard.
>
> I went over to Negro.
>
> I took a look around, and what I discovered is that
>
> tampon product names are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you've got names like "OB Pro."
>
> What is that?
>
> Is that like for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> That doesn't seem like something I want for my daughter.
>
> Or "Tampax Radiance."
>
> Like, what is that?
>
> Like glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> No idea about that.
>
> The one I like the most is called "Always Infinity."
>
> Because that's for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> I ended up in the end choosing another product from Horvitz.
>
> This product is fantastic.
>
> It's called "Always Home by 11."
>
> Wow.
>
> Because around about 10 o'clock, it starts to leak,
>
> and she is always home by 11.
>
> It's fantastic.
>
> You know, this whole experience was actually, for me,
>
> a very proud one as a father.
>
> Because, honestly, it's not every day that you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> All right, I think I'm done.
>
> I'm just going to leave.
>
> Please give it up for Harry.
