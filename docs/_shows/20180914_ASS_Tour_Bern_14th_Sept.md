<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> So we're about, actually, almost at the end of our first half. We only have one last comedian left
>
> in our first half, and we're very excited to have him here tonight.
>
> Without further ado, let me bring him up. Here he is, the very funny Harry Fox, everybody! Bring
>
> him up!
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fooks. It's a German name. Spelled F-O-O-C-K-S. I repeat, F-O-O-C-K-S.
>
> But all these English speakers here still think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> The problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high bar of expectations.
>
> Because if my name was Harry Fox, I would have come on here tonight and I would have been like, "Yo,
>
> what's up, Harry Fox in the house!"
>
> But that's not really me, I'm kind of quiet.
>
> And the other thing is, obviously, I actually need to fuck a lot. And that hasn't really been
>
> happening.
>
> Although, to say I'm actually a father and a single dad, I have two teenagers, so just enough
>
> happened for my genes to pass to another generation.
>
> I have these two teenagers, and I call them Halver and Wopper.
>
> And as a single dad, I'm always being confronted with situations I'm wholly unprepared for.
>
> For example, recently I came back from work, and I went into the bathroom, and oh my God, it looked
>
> like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was bloody hand print on the mirror, there was blood in the sink, drops of blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard this screaming, and I looked around, and I realized the screaming was coming from
>
> me.
>
> And at that point, my daughter showed up, and she said, "Hey, Dad, I got my period!"
>
> And after cleaning up my daughter's menstrual blood, she said, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And my daughter was like, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, as a man, I obviously know completely nothing about buying tampons, but I thought, "Hey, this
>
> can't be so hard."
>
> So I went to Medro, I took a look around, and what I learned is that tampon product names are
>
> exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> For example, you have names like OB-PRO, like professional women that bleed for a living.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance, glow-in-the-dark tampons for when the lights are off.
>
> The one I like the most is Always Infinity, for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> Anyway, it worked out okay, I chose something, it worked out fine for my daughter, and for me, it
>
> ended up being a very proud moment as a father.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crimes in her vagina.
>
> I know this because, you know, I've actually lived in Switzerland for 17 years now, and I'm
>
> actually in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> And when I get that passport, I'm going to be voting ESPAPÉ, because it's time to do something
>
> about all the immigrants.
>
> And specifically, I mean all the English-speaking immigrants.
>
> Because, let's take a look at what these guys have been doing, you know.
>
> They voted for Brexit, they voted for Trump, and then they go, "Oh my god, we fucked up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> And if you take a look, what are they actually bringing to the party here in Switzerland, it's
>
> really not that much.
>
> Because, you know, think about the Indians and the Vietnamese, when they came here, they brought
>
> great cuisine.
>
> Or, for example, the Brazilians and the Romanians, when they came here, they brought sexual relief.
>
> But these English speakers, you know, they're not even bothering to learn the language, they're
>
> going out in the evening and listening to stand-up comedy in English.
>
> So, you know, I'm going to make it my mission to prevent this country from getting stolen.
>
> And the reason for this actually goes back to my childhood, because when I was seven, something was
>
> taken from me.
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> Now, judging by the quiet response here, a lot of you don't know what circumcision is.
>
> Come talk to me after, I'll show you.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic experience in my childhood, as an adult, has turned into a real
>
> advantage.
>
> Because on those rare occasions where a woman does get in proximity with the end of my penis, she
>
> will invariably sigh, like, "Ugh."
>
> And I'd be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'd be like, "You have no idea how many dirty dicks there are out there."
>
> And what I learned, actually, what I learned is amongst my uncut brethren, a lot of you guys are
>
> not putting enough attention in this area.
>
> So what I thought, I would finish with just a few tips for you guys to help make your woman's life
>
> more pleasant.
>
> So, first thing you can do, thank you for that, she knows what it's about.
>
> The first thing you can do is, you know in your car, like on the rear view mirror, you have like an
>
> air freshener, a wonder balm, just hang it from your penis.
>
> Women are very sensitive to smell, that immediately makes their life better.
>
> Women are also very visual, so like right here, above your penis, just tattoo a pleasant scene.
>
> Like, a field of green grass with some flowers growing, maybe a tree with some birds singing, a
>
> couple of squirrels.
>
> You know, something to take her mind off the disgusting actress.
>
> But there is actually an easier thing you can do, is just simply bring a box of crackers with you
>
> while she's down there.
>
> Just kind of feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> I'm going to leave you with that one. Thank you very much.
