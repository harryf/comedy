> He's originally from England, he did our gigs a lot, and now he's back.
>
> Everybody, please, give it up for your next comedian, Harry Fox!
>
> So recently, I was walking down Badnerstrasse, over there,
>
> in the cool part of Zurich, where the hipsters live.
>
> And this young man came past me on his bicycle, on his hipster bicycle,
>
> and he looks me in the eye, and he does this.
>
> Now, first of all, I was actually quite impressed, because he was close to a
>
> tram track,
>
> and he pulled that off without wiping out.
>
> But then I thought, you know what?
>
> This guy is complete.
>
> He's completely right.
>
> I am a first-class masturbator.
>
> My hand and my penis is a love affair of over 40 years.
>
> That's longer than most of you have been on this planet,
>
> except for my jazz-playing friend there.
>
> He plays the blues.
>
> And if I'm honest, the things my hand knows about my penis,
>
> I can't really talk about, can I?
>
> But sometimes, when I go on a date, and I'm with a woman,
>
> and I think, "Yeah, she's kind of cute, but could she be my hand?"
>
> My hand doesn't want to go on dates.
>
> My hand doesn't need back rubs.
>
> My hand is not trying to post every moment on Instagram.
>
> My hand doesn't want babies one day.
>
> And when I look at my hand, it's actually pretty freaking perfect.
>
> And this has led me to think that I've actually reached a kind of a strange
>
> point in my life.
>
> Because I'm starting to think that maybe I don't actually need a woman in my
>
> life anymore.
>
> Because, you know, I'm actually, just to tell you a bit about my life,
>
> I'm a single dad, I have two teenage kids.
>
> They live with me, I cook, I clean, I run a house, I have that shit together.
>
> I have a career, it's going kind of OK.
>
> Actually, my boss is here tonight.
>
> And maybe I'll get Angela from here.
>
> And, you know, when I think about it, where am I going to fit a woman into this
>
> hectic schedule of working and parenting and jacking off?
>
> It's just hard to do, you know.
>
> I mean, recently, I was on a date with a woman.
>
> I was on this date.
>
> And, you know, what happened?
>
> We're talking about life.
>
> And I tell her I'm a single dad.
>
> And she immediately starts to tell me how to cook pasta.
>
> And in my head, I heard this voice of a gay black man saying, "Bitch, I can
>
> cook a five-course meal for breakfast!"
>
> I didn't say that, of course.
>
> I was like, "Oh, thank you. That's a very interesting pasta tip you have there."
>
> And then she said to me something that blew my mind.
>
> She said, "Maybe you just need a woman in your life."
>
> And I thought to myself, "Hmm, maybe it isn't you."
>
> Because actually, you know, if I think about it, the last -- I've basically
>
> been living with a woman for the last 20 years of my life.
>
> OK, so I have a lot of experience with this.
>
> And I can honestly say that living with a woman is hard.
>
> Now, yeah, you see, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
>
> We're sensing the tension level rising.
>
> So, you know, and I honestly say I don't hate women.
>
> I think women are wonderful.
>
> But living with a woman, living with a woman is kind of like living with a werewolf.
>
> You know, living with a werewolf.
>
> Because once a month, your darling, your loved one, will transform into this
>
> terrifying fucking mindset.
>
> There's going to be blood everywhere.
>
> And she's going to be growling at you because you put the sock in the wrong
>
> drawer.
>
> I'm getting some bro love. Thank you for that.
>
> You need the support because I'm feeling a lot of tension today.
>
> So, yeah, you know, and when I think about it, you know, it's like actually the
>
> last year of my life I've been single.
>
> And once I got used to it, I started to realize, wait a second, this is amazing.
>
> Because, like, for example, in the evening, if I have an idea, if I want to do
>
> something, I just do it.
>
> I just freaking do it.
>
> I don't need to go to, like, a man cave and, like, make some lame excuse or
>
> just quietly disappear.
>
> I just do it.
>
> And, you know, it's like other things as well.
>
> For example, if I cook a meal and I can just eat it while it's hot, I don't
>
> have to wait for her to post it on Instagram.
>
> It's really fucking amazing.
>
> And even better is I'm no longer spending my nights on the sofa watching New
>
> Girl and romantic comedies on Netflix.
>
> I got to see The Punisher on the day it came out.
>
> And so for me, I'm starting to realize that maybe I'm actually living the dream.
>
> Because sometimes when I'm stood there in front of my toilet with the seat up
>
> and I'm feeling that warm, wet spray of freedom hitting my lips, I think this
>
> is the dream.
>
> All right.
>
> Thank you.
>
> You've been great.
>
> I'm going to shake some hands.
>
> Thank you.
>
> I will shake your hand.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> Wow.
>
> Nice.
>
> Well done.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen --
