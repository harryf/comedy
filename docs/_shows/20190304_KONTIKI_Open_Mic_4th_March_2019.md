>
> This young man came past me on his bicycle
>
> on his hipster bicycle
>
> And he looks me in the eye, and he does this
>
> Now first of all, I was actually quite impressed because he was close to a tram

> track and he pulled that off without wiping out
>

>

>
> She's kind of cute
>
> My hand doesn't want to go on dates my hand doesn't need back rub
>
> My hand is not trying to post every moment on Instagram
>
> My hand doesn't want babies
>
> When I look at my hand, it's actually pretty freaking perfect

> Because I'm starting to think that maybe I don't actually need a woman in my
>
> life
>
> Because you know I'm actually just to tell you a bit about my life. I'm a

>
> And you know when I think about it
>
> Where am I going to fit a woman into this hectic schedule of working and
>
> parenting and jacking off?
>
> I mean recently. I was on a date with a woman. I was on this date and
>
> And we're talking about life, and I tell her I'm a single dad and she
>
> immediately
>
> Starts to tell me how to cook pasta
>
> And in my head I heard this voice of a gay black man
>
> Saying bitch I can cook a five-course meal for breakfast
>
> I didn't say that of course. I was like oh, thank you. That's a very
>
> interesting pasta tip you have there
>
> And then she said to me something that blew my mind. She said maybe you just
>
> need a woman in your life
>
> And I thought to myself
>
> Hmm. Maybe it isn't you
>
> Because actually you know if I think about it the last
>
> Basically been living with a woman for the last 20 years of my life
>
> Okay, so I have a lot of experience with this and I can honestly say that
>
> living with a woman is hard
>
> Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about
>
> We're sensing the tension level rising
>
> So
>
> Honestly say I don't hate women. I think women are wonderful
>
> But living with a woman living with a woman is kind of like living with a werewolf
>
> Because once a month your darling your loved one will transform into this
>
> terrifying fucking
>
> Everywhere
>
> In the wrong drawer
>
> I'm getting some bro love. Thank you for that. I need the support because I'm
>
> feeling a lot of tension
>
> So yeah, you know and and when I think about it, you know
>
> It's like actually the last year of my life I've been single and once I got

> used to it
>
> I started to realize wait a second. This is amazing
>
> It's like for example in the evening if I have an idea if I want to do
>
> something I just do it
>
> Just do it. I don't need to go to like a man cave and like make some lame
>
> excuse
>
> They'll just quietly disappear. I just do it and you know, it's like other
>
> things as well
>
> For example, if I cook a meal and I can just eat it while it's hot
>
> I'm gonna have to wait for her to post it on Instagram
>
> It's really fucking amazing and even better is I'm not no longer spending my nights
>
> on the sofa watching new girl
>
> I got to see the Punisher on the day it came out
>
> And so for me I'm starting to realize that maybe I'm actually living the dream
>
> Because sometimes when I'm stood there in front of my toilet
>
> with the seat up
>
> And I'm feeling that warm wet
>
> spray of freedom
