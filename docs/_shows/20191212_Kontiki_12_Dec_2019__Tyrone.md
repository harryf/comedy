> our staff. Folks, let's bring the energy up for this guy. He's originally from the UK but he's
>
> been living here for over 17 years. He's very funny and this is his real name. Ladies and gentlemen,
>
> give it up, it's Harry Fox everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox. And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of f*ckers. And I have two kids. I had to call them "how the" and "what
>
> the" just to give them a fair start in life. But you know, the problem with the name like Harry
>
> Fuchs, I get a lot of stupid comments. So this guy came up to me recently, he's like, "Yo, what's
>
> up
>
> man? Harry Fuchs! Harry Fuchs what, man?" I'm like, "What?" He's like, "Harry, yeah, Harry Fuchs
>
> what?"
>
> I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to throw him off with some adverbs right now, like Harry Fuchs hopefully,
>
> Harry Fuchs occasionally, Harry Fuchs enthusiastically." And that threw him off.
>
> But honestly, the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is I just simply haven't
>
> had enough f*cking to live up to that name. In fact, in recent times, I haven't had
>
> sex in a long time, if I can show it. Put your hand up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> What, John Marcos? And you work in IT? Okay, you're Italian, I get it, but you work in IT.
>
> Okay, I didn't realize I was coming to the Zurich Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meetup.
>
> All right, so to help you guys understand my condition and how it is when you haven't had sex
>
> for a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating. Because you could be walking
>
> down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses, you look at them and you
>
> think,
>
> "I wish that was me." Or you go into Migros, you spot an acción on a watermelon, you get one hand
>
> on that watermelon, maybe two. F*ck, it's like you're in a new dimension. It's just you and that
>
> watermelon, it's getting hot, you're oblivious to all the people looking. And then you hear this,
>
> "You're a man shaming zizig!" And there's this old lady about to hit you with a handbag and you
>
> think,
>
> "She's nice."
>
> But it's hard. And you know what makes this even worse is that even at my age,
>
> I still don't know if I'm any good at sex. Because I read recently that to be good at anything,
>
> it takes 10,000 hours. 10,000 hours is a lot of f*cking.
>
> I mean, if I add it all up, maybe I get to 5,000 hours, if I include masturbation.
>
> But you know, and you think about this, it's like, do you know that you need to f*ck
>
> 24 hours a day? If you f*ck 24 hours a day for an entire year, you're only at 8,000 hours, you know?
>
> Done the maths on this. If you live to 70, you need to f*ck 10 times a day from the day you were
>
> born
>
> until the day you die. And you know what's worse about that? The idea of newborn babies f*cking,
>
> or the thought of sex with old people on the day they're dying.
>
> I know, but you know, what's even more depressing about this is that when I see all of you wasting
>
> time listening to me, I know that all of you must suck at sex too. Jesus. Except for Adam here.
>
> You know, he's Egyptian. He's a very horny guy tonight. Adam. Adam. You're the horn man.
>
> Exactly. Adam, I hate to break this to you. There are only two types of people that think
>
> they're good at sex. Prostitutes and compulsive liars. Stop lying, Adam. You know you're a hoe.
>
> Jesus. But I don't know. I think the problem I've been having though is recently something
>
> bad happened. Recently I got dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend. Thank you. But it did make me
>
> now an expert on all Swiss women. And especially for Jimmy here. I have a few tips for you, Jimmy,
>
> for how you deal with a Swiss girlfriend. Because you know, they say certain things,
>
> and these are phrases you need to know, Jimmy. For example, if Desiree says to you, "Oh, schätzli,
>
> that is a good thing." That means later on there's a high chance of sexual favorites.
>
> But Jimmy, if she says to you, "Schätz!" That's a bad thing. That means you should
>
> probably spend the night on the sofa. But if she says to you, "Hurrigeil!" That is a fantastic
>
> thing. That means she's as horny as a whore. It's great. But Jimmy, if she says, "Leck mich doch am
>
> Arsch!" Under no circumstances should you try to lick Desiree's arsehole. Unless she says,
>
> "Das ist ein Schießdreck, man!" In which case you could try to lick her arsehole,
>
> but you might be in for a nasty surprise. I don't know. But it is a hard time for dating right now,
>
> especially for women, because I read a statistic recently and it said that almost 50% of men
>
> between 20 and 40 have sent a dick pic in the last three months. I'm looking around. I think
>
> we've got Rachel. Rachel has sent a lot of pics of his balls, at least, and probably there was
>
> some dick. No? No? Only in real life. You only deliver the personal dick pic. That is the best
>
> kind of dick pic Rachel. But for ladies, it might be a hard number to visualize, so let me try and
>
> explain it to you. Because if you give your number to 10 guys in this room tonight, by Christmas
>
> you
>
> could have a stack of five dicks on your phone and you can just print them out, use them as
>
> Christmas
>
> cards, hang them from your tree. There's a lot you can do with that. I don't take dick pics myself,
>
> not because I'm better than that, but because I'm a bit of a perfectionist, you know? Because
>
> taking a quality dick pic is hard. You've got to think about the lighting, you know? Do I go for
>
> some soft tones to bring out the flashy colors or maybe something more red and erotic? Do I need
>
> some props like some roses around here? It's dangerous, like all those thorns. And the hardest
>
> part is the angle. It's like, is it here or here? I don't know, but luckily I'm a bit of an
>
> entrepreneur. That's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick. You guys here can get it $29.99,
>
> dickpicselfiestick.com. Do I have time for one more? Okay, so, you know, I'm sorry to tell you
>
> so many kind of sexual jokes because, you know, I think it goes back to my childhood because
>
> when I was about seven, something was taken from me. That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, judging by this reaction, not a lot of you know what circumcision means.
>
> Come and see me after, I'll tell you. But actually, what began as a very traumatic
>
> childhood experience in adult life turned into a real advantage because on those rare occasions
>
> where a woman's head is close to the tip of my peanuts, she will invariably sigh like,
>
> I'd be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my peanuts?" And she'd be like,
>
> "You have no idea how many dirty dicks there are out there."
>
> Okay, there's a little bit of a laugh here. Okay, good. Because, you know, it is a problem.
>
> And so, you know, again, I have some tips for you. I don't know if this works for you, Jimmy,
>
> but we're going to go with them anyway. So, you know, it's things that you can do to make your
>
> woman's life more pleasant. It's like, for example, you know, in your car, you have that
>
> Wonderbaum hanging from your rearview mirror? Just hang it from your penis. That will immediately
>
> make her life more pleasant. Women are very sensitive to smell. Women are also very visual.
>
> So, like, right here, up above your penis, not below, up above, just tattoo a pleasant scene,
>
> like a field of green grass with some flowers growing in it. Maybe a tree with a few birds
>
> singing. You know, something to help take her mind off the disgusting, itchy ass of the home.
>
> But there is a simpler solution. There is a simpler thing you can do.
>
> Is you can just bring a box of crackers. And while she's down there, just feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> I love that. I love that. Because you know what that means? It means no one is getting any sex
>
> tonight, and we're now all in one team together. Thank you. That means a lot to me. You guys have
>
> been great. Have a good night. Give it up, everybody. That was Harry Fox one more time.
