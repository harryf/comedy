> Oh my god. She's so special. Okay, everybody, very nice. We're moving
>
> everything along.
>
> Let me bring up the next act of tonight, okay? So tonight we have another
>
> British man, okay?
>
> But this British man, he actually has been living in Switzerland for close to
>
> 20 years,
>
> okay? Now as I bring him up, I want to tell you one last thing. This is his
>
> real name.
>
> Give it up, everybody, for Harry Fox. Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name. It's spelled F-U-C-H-U-F-U-X.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S. When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot
>
> of you think
>
> my name is Harry Fuchs. My name is not Harry Fuchs. And in my family, when we
>
> have a family
>
> get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers. And I have
>
> two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halva and Wanda.
>
> The real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectations.
>
> Honestly, I've only really done about this much. In fact, recently, I haven't
>
> had sex
>
> in a long time. Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Bacon? Not you?
>
> I don't know. Okay, so clearly, I'm at the Freiburg Nymphomaniacs Anonymous
>
> meet-up.
>
> I wasn't expecting that tonight. But let me try and explain this to you, like,
>
> how it
>
> is when you haven't had sex in a long time. Because it's kind of like you're
>
> hallucinating.
>
> You know, you could be walking down the street, spot a couple of dogs sniffing
>
> each other's
>
> asses. You look at them and you think, I wish that was me. I wish that was me.
>
> I wish that
>
> Or you go in the supermarket and you see a special offer on watermelon. You get
>
> one hand on that watermelon, maybe two. BAM! It's like you're in a new
>
> dimension, it's just you and that watermelon. It's getting hot, it's getting
>
> steamy, you're oblivious to all the people watching. And then you hear this old
>
> lady going, you're the man Sheamus is in, can you look? And you think, wow, she's
>
> nice.
>
> That's how that is. But it actually gets kind of worse, because even at my age,
>
> I don't know if I'm actually any good at sex.
>
> Because I read recently that if you're good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to work.
>
> But maybe I get to 5,000 hours, if I include masturbation.
>
> But I did some maths on this, and what I figured out is that if you fuck for 24
>
> hours a day for an entire year, you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born.
>
> And so the day you die, and I don't know what's worse about that, that idea of
>
> you all maybe fucking, or the idea of sex with all people, on the very day of
>
> dying.
>
> But you know, this is kind of depressing for me.
>
> But what's even more depressing is right here, right now in this room, when I
>
> look at all of you wasting time listening to me, and know that, oh, you must
>
> suck at sex too.
>
> You must suck at sex too.
>
> This is fucking terrible, you know.
>
> Of course, someone here is thinking this is bullshit.
>
> I know I'm good at sex, like Spartacus here.
>
> You know, he's a Russian, he's very horny.
>
> Spartacus, I hate to break this to you, but I mean, two types of people that
>
> think that you're sick.
>
> Frosty cheese and a fake horse's life.
>
> Stop lying, Spartacus, you know you're a hoe.
>
> Yeah, anyway, so, but, I don't know, being Harry Fox just hasn't really been
>
> working out the way I wanted it to.
>
> But what it has led to, unfortunately, is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up to me, and he said, "Yo, what's up,
>
> man? Harry Fox. Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> And he's like, "Exactly. Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Okay, okay."
>
> I can throw him off with some adverts, I'm sure.
>
> Like, "Harry Fox hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fox occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fox enthusiastically."
>
> He's like, "No, man, no. Harry Fox goats, man. Harry Fox chickens. Harry Fox
>
> tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of
>
> mankind,
>
> we've never successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And actually, what this made me realize is that there is actually a whole
>
> category of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like, take hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you may get up behind a hippo and be like, "Wow, that is a sweet ass."
>
> Don't do it.
>
> Hippos are very dangerous.
>
> They are the most dangerous land mammal, kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Oh, orphans, for example, you know, it's just too high up.
>
> Even for Spartacus, he just can't get up there.
>
> Of course, if the mom isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> All right, all right, Spartacus, I got this.
>
> No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
>
> I'm just finding your level, okay?
>
> I see you're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> All right, we'll try and stay away from that.
>
> All right, okay, let me see if I can find a nice, safe topic for you.
>
> Oh, Christmas.
>
> Do you guys have a good Christmas?
>
> Wow, well, I had a shitty Christmas.
>
> Because, you know, I was feeling kind of sad and depressed about all the sex I'm
>
> not getting.
>
> And I did what a real man does under these circumstances.
>
> I got on YouTube, watched nature videos, and cried.
>
> But then, but then I discovered an animal.
>
> This animal cheered me up.
>
> This animal is so amazing.
>
> I can hardly believe that I got to 46 without knowing about it.
>
> Can you guess what this animal is, Spartacus?
>
> Okay, are you still thinking about baby elephants?
>
> Stop that, Spartacus.
>
> We are done with that part of the show now.
>
> Do you understand?
>
> No, the animal I'm talking about is the Argonaut octopus.
>
> This animal is incredible.
>
> Now, I need to explain this to you a little bit.
>
> So, the male Argonaut octopus, well, the female is extremely aggressive.
>
> And if the male gets anywhere near her, she's going to eat it.
>
> So, the males are terrified of the females.
>
> I think that's probably a few words here.
>
> So, the male has developed a unique solution.
>
> Let me put on my David Attenborough voice and try to explain this to you.
>
> When the male octopus...
>
> Spots a female who detaches his penis and the penis swims through the water and
>
> hoes
>
> in on the female's vagina.
>
> I mean, not your vagina.
>
> I kid you not.
>
> This is for real.
>
> Let me just explain that in layman's terms.
>
> There is an octopus with a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> It's incredible.
>
> Like, Google that shit.
>
> This is real.
>
> This is really chilling out.
>
> And then I got to thinking, like, what if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> That could change everything, you know.
>
> I just think it's Monday morning and, like, Heather, for example, you know.
>
> She's waiting at the bus stop to go to work just trying to follow all the
>
> German rules she's in with.
>
> She's just, like, occupied with that.
>
> Like, bam!
>
> Dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She has to, like, hide behind some old ladies to throw it up.
>
> She pulls out her dick shield like Captain America.
>
> Dicks are just flying around, slapping off the shield.
>
> It's, like, crazy.
>
> Bus arrives.
>
> She jumps in.
>
> Arrives at the office, finally safe.
>
> This is a sign saying, "Please keep your penis attached during office hours."
>
> It's crazy stuff.
>
> And the more...
>
> The crazier this thought goes.
>
> You know, I started thinking, like, we probably start having, like, dick-related
>
> sports, for example.
>
> Like dick racing at the Olympics.
>
> You've got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike probably starts sponsoring dicks.
>
> Just dick it.
>
> They've got a whole range of sportswear.
>
> You go into Daniela's sports shop.
>
> Say, "I'm looking for some dick wear."
>
> She said, "Well, we're going to have to measure you up, sir."
>
> And it's just like, "Oh, fuck.
>
> That's not what I came here for."
>
> Crazy stuff.
>
> But, yeah, the more I thought about this, the more...
>
> It raises more questions than universal basic income.
>
> Like, imagine, imagine what would happen if you lost your dick.
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> You'd just have to pull out your phone, like, "Find my penis."
>
> Or what about, "Could you borrow your friend's dick?"
>
> "I wasn't cheating.
>
> It was his dick."
>
> Or you have, like, a rough night with your buddies.
>
> You wake up in the morning.
>
> You're like a horse going on.
>
> You find your dick in the corner.
>
> You're like, "What the fuck?
>
> That is disgusting.
>
> That's gross.
>
> Oh, my God."
>
> That would be...
>
> Just so many things that detachable dicks would lead to.
>
> Yeah.
>
> But then I go thinking, "What if, when you shoot your dick, it is a one-time
>
> only thing,
>
> and then you have to wait three months for a new dick to grow?"
>
> Yeah.
>
> Heather gets the point.
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> Because, you know, then girls, when they get together on Sunday for brunch,
>
> they'd be like,
>
> "Oh, it was so romantic.
>
> You know, we went shopping.
>
> We went for a walk in the park.
>
> And then he gave me his dick.
>
> It was so touching."
>
> Or, like, a kid's talking to his dad, like, "Do I really have to give my dick
>
> away, dad?"
>
> It's like, "Son, you need the right woman."
>
> Or, like, Heather's talking to her dad, like, "Do I really have to give my dick
>
> away, dad?"
>
> It's like, "Son, you need the right woman."
>
> Or, like, Heather's talking to her dad, like, "Do I really have to give my dick
>
> away, dad?"
>
> It's like, "Son, you need the right woman."
>
> Then he gave me his dick. It was so touching.
>
> Or like a kid's talking to his dad like, do I really have to give my dick away?
>
> Dad is like, son, you need the right woman.
>
> Or like Heather and Jan, you know, you ask them how long have you guys been
>
> together?
>
> They're no longer answering years.
>
> Like Heather's like, yeah, I think I've been together for about like 17 dicks.
>
> And Jan is like, Heather, it was 18. I am a German engineer. I have measured
>
> this.
>
> It'd be crazy stuff.
>
> Anyway, that's how I cheered up my Christmas.
>
> Just thinking about this stuff, I was very happy.
>
> Yeah, but, you know, let's try and get a bit more real now.
>
> Let's get to the way that things happen in reality.
>
> And of course, I'm talking about dick pics.
>
> Because I read the crazy statistic recently.
>
> It said that in the last 12 months, almost 50% of men between the ages of 20
>
> and 40
>
> sent a dick pic.
>
> It's crazy. I'm just looking around here.
>
> There's a couple of guys here looking a bit dick picky.
>
> Yeah, oh shit.
>
> Yeah, but it's spotted. Exactly.
>
> You have a spotted dick. Wow.
>
> Wow. That is an amazing penis you have there.
>
> So, no, but actually, you know, it's a crazy thing.
>
> And ladies, to visualize that statistic,
>
> if you were to give your number to,
>
> 10 guys in this room tonight,
>
> by Christmas 2020,
>
> you'd have a stack of five dicks on your phone.
>
> You could just print them out, use them as Christmas cards.
>
> Just like hang them from your Christmas tree.
>
> It would be the best Christmas ever.
>
> But, you know, I don't take dick pics myself.
>
> I hear the disbelief.
>
> But it's not because I think it's wrong.
>
> It's because I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because taking a quality,
>
> dick pic is hard.
>
> There's a lot to think about.
>
> You've got to think about the lighting.
>
> Do you go for like a soft tone to bring out the spotty colors?
>
> Or, you know, do you need something more red and erotic?
>
> What about some props around here?
>
> Do I need some roses?
>
> That's kind of dangerous. Could prick my dick.
>
> And it's a selfie, of course.
>
> Like, what angle am I going to like, here or here or, like...
>
> No, but luckily,
>
> for you guys, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> That's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> You two guys get a special offer tonight on dickpicselfiestick.com.
>
> Start making good quality dick pics.
>
> Yeah, so, I don't know.
>
> Okay, I'm going to wrap it up.
>
> You know, I just, maybe I should apologize.
>
> I've told you a lot of dirty jokes.
>
> And I think the reason for that goes back to my childhood.
>
> Because when I was about seven, something was taking pretty me.
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, judging from that reaction, not a lot of you know what circumcision means.
>
> Just come and talk to me after, I'll show you.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic childhood experience
>
> in adult life turned into a real advantage,
>
> which was on those rare occasions
>
> where a woman's head finds itself close to the tip of my penis,
>
> she will invariably sigh, like, "Oh."
>
> And I'd be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'd be like, "You have no idea how many dirty dicks there are, Heather."
>
> Yeah, I think Heather again,
>
> has a lot of dirty dicks.
>
> I'm sorry you had to deal with that, Heather.
>
> Yeah, I'm cleaning up, man.
>
> Because what I learned was,
>
> well, Heather's like, "Oh, no, I don't really mind."
>
> And she does.
>
> What I learned is that amongst my uncut brethren,
>
> a lot of you guys are not putting enough attention in this area.
>
> So, I thought I'd wrap up with a few tips, especially for young,
>
> to help make you--
>
> He's an example, actually, I must say.
>
> Okay, Heather, you're gonna love the tips I've got for you.
>
> And I'm not talking that tip, I'm talking tips
>
> to make you love life better.
>
> Because, you know, for example, you know, does Jan have a car?
>
> -Yes. -Okay, does he have a wunderbaum
>
> hanging from the mirror, where I put an air freshener?
>
> -No. -Well, he should get one,
>
> and then just hang it from his penis.
>
> Because that's gonna immediately make your life more pleasant,
>
> because women are very sensitive to smell, you know.
>
> Or another thing you could do, Jan, is right here, up above your penis,
>
> you just tattoo a pleasant scene, like a field of green grass,
>
> -Yeah. -You just tattoo a pleasant scene, like a field of green grass,
>
> -Yeah. -Like a field of green grass,
>
> with some flowers growing in it.
>
> Or just maybe a tree with a few birds singing in it.
>
> You know, something to help take Heather's mind
>
> off the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But there is a simpler technique, something that's very simple, Jan,
>
> if that's all too complicated.
>
> All you gotta do is just bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while Heather's down there, you just feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> All right. I love that. I love that.
>
> Because do you know what it means?
>
> It means that no one here is getting sex tonight,
>
> and now we're all in one team together.
>
> That's fantastic. You guys have been fantastic.
>
> Have a good night.
>
> Give it up for those hairy fucks, everybody, please.
>
> Oh, my goodness.
>
> Well, we all learned a little bit.
>
> We all learned a little bit about each other.
>
> Okay. We have one last act left in...
