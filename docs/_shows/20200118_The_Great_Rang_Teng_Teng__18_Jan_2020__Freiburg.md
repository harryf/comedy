> Oh my god, she's so special.
>
> Okay everybody, very nice, we're moving everything along.
>
> Let me bring up the next act of tonight, okay?
>
> So tonight we have another British man, okay?
>
> But, this British man, he actually has been living in Switzerland for close to 20 years, okay?
>
> Now as I bring him up, I want to tell you one last thing.
>
> This is his real name.
>
> Give it up everybody for Harry Fuchs!
>
> Give it up for Harry Fuchs everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when we call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halver and Wotter.
>
> Just to give them a good start on it.
>
> The real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is it sets a very high level of expectations.
>
> And honestly, I've only really done about this much.
>
> Okay, obviously it's that much.
>
> In fact, recently I haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Yeah, put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> No? Begun?
>
> Not you?
>
> Whoever says a begun?
>
> I don't know.
>
> Okay, so clearly I'm at the Freiburg Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meetup.
>
> I wasn't expecting that tonight.
>
> But let me try and explain this to you, like, how it is when you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Because it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You know, you could be walking down the street.
>
> You spot a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> You look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go in the supermarket and you see a special offer on a watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon.
>
> Maybe two.
>
> Bam! It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot. It's getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this old lady going, "Junge man, schämen Sie sich!"
>
> And you look and you think, "Wow, she's nice."
>
> Yeah, that's how that is.
>
> But, you know, it actually gets kind of worse.
>
> Because, you know, even at my age, I wouldn't know if I'm actually any good at sex.
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of masturbation.
>
> Maybe if I add it all up, maybe I get to 5,000 hours.
>
> If I include masturbation.
>
> But I did some maths on this.
>
> And what I figured out is that if you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year,
>
> you're only 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born
>
> until the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worst about that, that whole "Do you want babies?" fucking thing.
>
> Or the idea of sex with all people.
>
> On the day they die.
>
> But, you know, this is kind of depressing for me.
>
> But what's even more depressing is right here, right now in this room,
>
> when I look at all of you wasting time listening to me.
>
> I know that all of you must suck at sex, too.
>
> This is fucking terrible, you know.
>
> Of course, someone here is thinking, "This is bullshit. I know I'm good at sex."
>
> Spartacus!
>
> He's a mushroom. He's very horny.
>
> Spartacus, I hate to break this to you, but there are only two types of people that think like this.
>
> Stop lying, Spartacus! You know you're a hoe!
>
> Yeah, anyway, so, yeah.
>
> But, I know, being Harry Fox just hasn't really been working out for what I wanted it to.
>
> But what it has led to, unfortunately, is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Like, recently, this American tourist came up to me.
>
> And he said, "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fox! Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> And he's like, "Exactly. Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Okay, okay."
>
> I can throw him off with some adverbs, I'm sure.
>
> Like, "Harry Fox hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fox occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fox enthusiastically."
>
> He's like, "No, man, no! Harry Fox don'ts, man! Harry Fox chickens! Harry Fox tigers!"
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And actually, what this made me realize is that there is actually a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals.
>
> Like, take hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you may get up behind a hippo and be like, "Wow, that is a sweet ass."
>
> Don't do it. Hippos are very dangerous. They are the most dangerous land mammal.
>
> Kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Oh, elephants, for example, you know.
>
> It's just too high up, even for Spartacus.
>
> He can't get up there.
>
> Of course, if the mum isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> All right, all right, Spartacus. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just finding your level, okay?
>
> I see you're okay with bestiality, but not paedophile bestiality.
>
> All right, we'll try and stay away from it.
>
> Okay, let me see if I can find a nice, safe topic for you.
>
> What? Christmas. Do you guys have a good Christmas?
>
> Wow, well, I had a shitty Christmas.
>
> Because, you know, I was feeling kind of sad and depressed about all the sex I'm not getting.
>
> And I did what a real man does under these circumstances.
>
> I got on YouTube, watched nature videos, and cried.
>
> But then, but then I discovered an animal. This animal cheered me up.
>
> This animal is so amazing, I can hardly believe that I got to 46 without knowing about it.
>
> Can you guess what this animal is, Spartacus?
>
> Okay, are you still thinking about baby elephants?
>
> Stop that, Spartacus. We are done with that part of the show now.
>
> Do you understand?
>
> No, the animal I'm talking about is the argonaut octopus.
>
> This animal is incredible.
>
> Now, I need to explain this to you a little bit.
>
> So, the male argonaut octopus, well, the female is extremely aggressive,
>
> and if the male gets anywhere near her, she's going to eat it.
>
> So, the males are terrified of the females.
>
> I think it's probably a female.
>
> So, the male has developed a unique solution.
>
> Let me put on my David Attenborough voice and try and explain this to you.
>
> When the male octopus spots a female, he detaches his penis,
>
> and the penis swims through the water, and homes in on the female's vagina.
>
> Not your vagina.
>
> I kid you not, this is for real.
>
> Let me just explain that in layman's terms.
>
> There is an octopus with a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> It's incredible.
>
> Google that shit.
>
> This is real.
>
> This is really chilling.
>
> And then I got to thinking, what if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> That could change everything.
>
> I just think, it's Monday morning, and Heather, for example,
>
> she's waiting at the bus stop to go to work,
>
> just trying to follow all the German rules she's in with.
>
> She's just occupied with that, and like, BANG!
>
> A dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She has to hide behind some old ladies to throw it off.
>
> She pulls out her dick shield like Captain America.
>
> Dicks are just flying around, slapping off the shield.
>
> It's like crazy.
>
> Bus arrives, she jumps in, arrives at the office finally safe.
>
> This is a sign saying, "Please keep your penis attached during office hours."
>
> It's crazy stuff.
>
> And the more--the crazier this thought got, you know,
>
> I started thinking, like, we probably start having, like, dick-related sports, for example.
>
> Like dick racing at the Olympics.
>
> You've got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike probably starts sponsoring dicks.
>
> Just dick it. They've got a whole range of sports.
>
> You go into Daniela's sports shop, say, "I'm looking for some dick wears."
>
> She says, "Well, we're going to have to measure you up, sir."
>
> And it's just like, "Oh, fuck. That's not what I came here for."
>
> Crazy stuff.
>
> The more I thought about this, it raises more questions
>
> than universal basic income.
>
> Like, imagine--imagine what would happen if you lost your dick.
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> You'd just have to pull out your phone, like, "Find my penis."
>
> Or what about, "Could you borrow your friend's dick?"
>
> "I wasn't cheating. It was his dick!"
>
> Or you have, like, a rough night with your buddies.
>
> You wake up in the morning. You're like, "Oh, what's going on?"
>
> You find your dick in the corner. You're like, "What the fuck?
>
> That is disgusting. That's gross.
>
> Oh, my God. That would be just so many things
>
> that detachable dicks would lead to."
>
> But then I got thinking, "What if, when you shoot your dick,
>
> it is a one-time only thing, and then you have to wait three months
>
> for a new dick to grow?"
>
> Yeah, I have against the program.
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> Because, you know, then girls, when they get together on Sunday for brunch,
>
> they'd be like, "Oh, it was so romantic.
>
> You know, we went shopping. We went for a walk in the park.
>
> And then he gave me his dick. It was so touching."
>
> Or, like, a kid's talking to his dad, like,
>
> "Do I really have to give my dick away?"
>
> Dad is like, "Son, you need the right woman."
>
> Or, like, Heather and Yan, you know, you ask them,
>
> "How long will you guys be together?"
>
> They no longer answer in years.
>
> Like, Heather's like, "Yeah, I think we've been together
>
> for about, like, 17 dicks."
>
> And Yan is like, "Heather, when I was 18, I am a German engineer.
>
> I have measured this."
>
> It'd be crazy stuff, yeah.
>
> Anyway, that's how I cheered up my Christmas,
>
> you know, just thinking about this stuff.
>
> I was very happy.
>
> Yeah, but, you know, let's try and get a bit more real now.
>
> Let's get to the way that things happen in reality.
>
> And, of course, I'm talking about dick pics.
>
> Because I read the crazy statistic recently.
>
> It said that in the last 12 months,
>
> almost 50% of men between the ages of 20 and 40
>
> sent a dick pic.
>
> That is crazy.
>
> I'm just looking around here.
>
> There's a couple of guys here looking a bit dick picky.
>
> Yeah, oh, shit.
>
> Yeah, but--
>
> -Spotted.
>
> -Spotted, exactly.
>
> You have a spotted dick.
>
> Wow!
>
> Wow!
>
> That is an amazing penis you have there.
>
> So, no, but actually, you know, it's a crazy thing.
>
> And, ladies, to visualize that statistic,
>
> if you were to give your number to 10 guys in this room tonight,
>
> by Christmas 2020,
>
> you'd have a stack of five dicks on your phone.
>
> You could just print them out, use them as Christmas cards.
>
> Just, like, hang them from your Christmas tree.
>
> It would be the best Christmas ever.
>
> But, you know, I don't take dick pics myself.
>
> I hear the disbelief.
>
> But--
>
> Actually, but it's not because I think it's wrong.
>
> It's because I'm a bit of a perfectionist, you know?
>
> Because taking a quality dick pic is hard.
>
> There's a lot to think about.
>
> You've got to think about the lighting.
>
> Do you go for, like, a soft tone to bring out the spotty colors?
>
> Or, you know, do you need something more red or neurotic?
>
> What about some props around here?
>
> Do I need some roses?
>
> That's kind of dangerous, could poke my dick.
>
> And it's a selfie, of course.
>
> Like, what angle am I going to?
>
> Like, here or here or, like--
>
> No, but luckily for you guys, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> That's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> You two guys get a special offer tonight on dickpicselfiestick.com.
>
> Start making good quality dick pics.
>
> Yeah, so--I don't know.
>
> Okay, I'm going to wrap it up.
>
> You know, I just--maybe I should apologize.
>
> I've told you a lot of, like, dirty jokes,
>
> and I think the reason for that goes back to my childhood.
>
> Because when I was about seven, something was taking pretty--
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, judging from that reaction,
>
> not a lot of you know what circumcision means.
>
> Just come and talk to me after, and I'll show you.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic childhood experience
>
> in adult life turned into a real advantage,
>
> was on those rare occasions where a woman's head
>
> finds itself close to the tip of my penis,
>
> she will invariably sigh, like, "Oh."
>
> And I'll be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'll be like, "You have no idea
>
> how many dirty dicks there are, Heather."
>
> Yeah, I think Heather, again--
>
> --has a lot of dirty dicks.
>
> I'm sorry you had to deal with that, Heather.
>
> Yeah, clean it up, man.
>
> What I learned was--
>
> Heather's like, "Oh, no, I don't really mind."
>
> She does.
>
> But what I learned is, amongst my uncut brethren,
>
> a lot of you guys are not paying enough attention
>
> in this area.
>
> So I thought I'd wrap up with a few tips,
>
> especially for Yang, to help make you--
>
> He's an example, actually, I must say.
>
> OK, Heather, you're going to love the tips I've got for you.
>
> And I'm not talking that tip.
>
> I'm talking tips to make your love life better.
>
> Because, for example, does Yang have a car?
>
> Yes.
>
> OK, does he have a Wonderbaum hanging from the mirror
>
> or an air freshener?
>
> No.
>
> Well, he should get one and then just hang it from his penis.
>
> Because that's going to immediately make your life
>
> more pleasant.
>
> Because women are very sensitive to smell.
>
> Or another thing you could do, Yang,
>
> is right here, up above your penis,
>
> you just tattoo a pleasant scene,
>
> like a field of green grass with some flowers growing in it.
>
> Or just maybe a tree with a few birds singing in it.
>
> Something to help take Heather's mind
>
> off the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But there is a simpler technique,
>
> something that's very simple.
>
> Yang, if that's all too complicated,
>
> all you've got to do is just bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while Heather's down there, you just feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> I love that. I love that.
>
> Because do you know what it means?
>
> It means that no one here is getting sex tonight.
>
> And now we're all in one team together.
>
> That's fantastic.
>
> You guys have been fantastic.
>
> Have a great night.
>
> Give it up for those Harry Pots, everybody.
>
> Oh, my goodness.
>
> Well, we all learned a little bit about each other.
>
> Okay, we have one last act left.
