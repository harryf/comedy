> See? Who's next? Ladies and gentlemen, we only have actually a couple of
>
> comments left, 3-4 comments left.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, I want to bring up this next comedian, but he's special.
>
> He gets his own music.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, coming up on stage, the sexiest man, the sexiest guy in
>
> Zurich.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually not Harry Fox. It's Harry Fooks. It's spelled F-O-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-O-C-K-S.
>
> There are so many English speakers like that guy over there, you'd think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> See, the problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> And I just simply haven't done enough fucking.
>
> You know, it really actually causes me a lot of pain because I come from many
>
> generations of fuckers.
>
> And I feel like I'm letting it all down.
>
> Because, you know, the problem, basically, let's get straight to it, the
>
> problem is women.
>
> Women are just making it too hard for me to fuck.
>
> You know, and I think about this a lot. I think about it, you know, recently I
>
> was thinking like lesbians, for example.
>
> Do lesbians fuck on the first date?
>
> Because I know gay men do. They have like Grindr, you know, you can download
>
> Grindr.
>
> Within 30 minutes you can be fucking.
>
> I mean, you're going to be in a public toilet, there's some shit smeared on the
>
> wall.
>
> But at least you're fucking.
>
> What about you two guys? Did you meet in a public toilet?
>
> No, let's shake hands. Where did you guys meet?
>
> Tinder.
>
> Tinder!
>
> Motherfuckers!
>
> No, no, no, no!
>
> Fucking up my whole acting.
>
> But, you know, let's get back to it.
>
> Let's move swiftly back to lesbians.
>
> Are there any lesbians here tonight?
>
> No, because lesbians are like ninjas, you can never see them.
>
> But, you know, my problem is I'm basically like a three-date kind of guy.
>
> It's like women are going to make me go through at least three dates before
>
> there is any hope that I'm going to fuck them.
>
> And during that process, we're going to be reviewing my entire dating history.
>
> My financial forecast for 2020.
>
> And we're going to paint this picture of the two of us in 50 years.
>
> And I'm going to be dead in 50 years.
>
> She's just going to be sat by my grave.
>
> And it's exhausting. It's exhausting for me.
>
> Sometimes, like around the second date, I'll just be like, "Oh, fuck, man. My
>
> balls are aching because they're so blue."
>
> And I'm like, "Fuck, why am I doing this to myself? It's just like self-hatred.
>
> Why do I have to go through this?"
>
> And that gets me thinking about lesbians.
>
> Because, you know, if I find out that lesbians have an app like Grindr,
>
> and that within 13 minutes they're on our park bench doing this shit,
>
> I am going to be pissed!
>
> I'm going to be angry because, you know, it's like, where's the equality in
>
> that?
>
> Where's the equality?
>
> For guys, I have to go through three dates because they're giving out free
>
> pussy to other women.
>
> It's just not good.
>
> But, I don't know. At some level, I get it.
>
> Because for women, I think for women, if there's a guy you like and you sleep
>
> with him,
>
> what comes after, it makes you very nervous.
>
> Because you're going to be like, "Is he going to call me? Was he just using me
>
> for sex?"
>
> "Is he going to tag me on Instagram with 'WE'RE FUCKING'?"
>
> You know, that's all the stuff that they've got to deal with.
>
> Yeah, some of the girls back there laugh on the internet.
>
> So, you know, and what I've been thinking about is maybe there's a way that we
>
> can reduce the anxiety for women.
>
> And then it struck me, there is a magic moment that all guys have when they
>
> know if they like a woman.
>
> And it's after the first time we sleep with you.
>
> On the next day, you go into work and you're tired, you've had like one hour's
>
> sleep.
>
> But you're high on endorphins.
>
> And you go up to that coffee machine, you press the button, you get yourself a
>
> cup of coffee.
>
> You lift it to your face.
>
> And that's when it hits you.
>
> The smell.
>
> Now, I know that's kind of shocking, but it is true.
>
> Because if a guy likes you, he's going to be like, "Mmm, I am a man."
>
> "Mmm, I've got to get some more of this."
>
> But if a guy likes you, he's going to be on that call going,
>
> "Fuck! What the fuck is this? Someone please cut off my hand."
>
> And for me, I have a beard.
>
> It takes days for me to wash that shit off.
>
> It's like I'm walking around in this pussy helmet.
>
> And if I don't like you, we're not going to talk again.
>
> So here's my advice to women.
>
> It's like on the day after you've had sex, you've got to do something,
>
> which I know for most of this generation is very hard because you like texting.
>
> You've got to call him.
>
> You call the guy and you'd be like, "Hey, how are you doing?"
>
> "Listen, I'm just calling quickly because you left something at my place."
>
> "You forgot your phone charger."
>
> And he's going to have his phone up near his face.
>
> And so he's telling the truth because he can smell it.
>
> And he's going to be like--if he likes you, he's going to be like,
>
> "Yeah, oh, thank you. Maybe I can come around this evening and charge up my
>
> phone."
>
> But if he doesn't like you, he's going to be like,
>
> "Yeah, you know, don't worry about it because I'm getting a new phone anyway.
>
> This one kind of stinks. It's over there."
>
> But the good news is at least you can get over it quickly.
>
> So that's my message to you.
>
> You guys, you smell great.
>
> Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Harry doing some clean comedy for you guys, very nice.
>
> Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we only have three comics left and these guys are
>
> great.
>
> I want to bring up the next one without any further ado.
>
> Here he is, everybody, Adrian Folkler! Give it up!
