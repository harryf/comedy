> See, who is next? Ladies and gentlemen, we only have actually a couple of
>
> comments left.
>
> We have three or four comments left.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, I want to bring up this next comedian, but he is special.
>
> He gets his own music.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, coming up on stage, the sexiest man, the sexiest dad in
>
> Zurich.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually not Harry Fox.
>
> It's Harry Fooks. It's spelled F-U-C-K-S-R-P-F-U-C-K-S.
>
> There are so many English speakers like that guy over there.
>
> You'd think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> See, the problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> And I just simply haven't done enough fucking.
>
> And, you know, it really actually causes me a lot of pain because I come from
>
> many generations of fuckers.
>
> And I feel like I'm letting it all down.
>
> Because, you know, the problem...
>
> The problem, basically, let's get straight to it.
>
> The problem is women.
>
> Women are just making it too hard for me to fuck.
>
> You know, and I think about this a lot.
>
> I think about it, you know, recently I was thinking like lesbians, for example.
>
> Do lesbians fuck on the first date?
>
> Because I know gay men do.
>
> They have like Grindr, you know.
>
> You can download Grindr.
>
> Within 30 minutes, you can be fucking.
>
> I mean, you're going to be in a public toilet.
>
> There's some shit smeared on the wall.
>
> You better at least you're fucking.
>
> What about you two guys?
>
> Did you meet in a public toilet?
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> You know, they're shaking their head.
>
> Where did you guys meet?
>
> Tinder.
>
> Tinder.
>
> Mother fucking...
>
> No, no, no.
>
> No.
>
> No, no, no.
>
> Fucking out my whole active.
>
> But, you know, let's move swiftly back to lesbians.
>
> Are there any lesbians here tonight?
>
> No, because lesbians are like ninjas.
>
> You can never see them.
>
> But, you know, my problem is I'm basically like a three-day kind of guy.
>
> It's like women are going to make me go through at least three dates before
>
> there is.
>
> And I don't have any hope that I'm going to fucking.
>
> You know, and during that process, we're going to be reviewing my entire dating
>
> history.
>
> My financial forecast for 2020.
>
> And we're going to paint this picture of the two of us in 50 years.
>
> You know, and I'm going to be dead in 50 years.
>
> It's like she's just going to be sat by my grave.
>
> It's really...
>
> And it's exhausting.
>
> It's exhausting for me, you know.
>
> Sometimes...
>
> Like around the...
>
> Second date, I'll just be like, oh, fuck, man.
>
> My balls are aching because it's so blue.
>
> And I'm like, fuck, why am I doing this to myself?
>
> It's just like self-hatred.
>
> Why do I have to go through this?
>
> And that gets me thinking about lesbians.
>
> Because, you know, if I find out that lesbians have an app like Grindr,
>
> and that within 30 minutes they're on a park bench doing this shit,
>
> I am going to be pissed.
>
> I'm going to be angry.
>
> Because, you know, it's like...
>
> Where's the...
>
> Where's the equality in that?
>
> Where's the equality?
>
> You know, for guys, I have to go through three dates
>
> because they're giving out free pussy to other women.
>
> It's just not good, you know.
>
> You know, but...
>
> I don't know.
>
> At some level, I get it.
>
> I get it, you know.
>
> Because for women...
>
> I think for women, like, if there's a guy you like and you sleep with him,
>
> what comes after it makes you very nervous, you know.
>
> Because you're going to be like, is he going to call me?
>
> Was he...
>
> Was he just using me for sex?
>
> Is he going to tag me on Instagram with,
>
> We're fucking!
>
> You know, that's all the stuff that they've got to deal with.
>
> Yeah, some of the girls back there love him.
>
> So, you know, and...
>
> What I've been thinking about is maybe there's a way that we can reduce the
>
> anxiety for women.
>
> And then it's struggling.
>
> There is a magic moment that all guys have when they know if they like a woman.
>
> And it's after the first time...
>
> And it's after the first time we sleep with you.
>
> On the next day, you go into work and you're tired.
>
> You've had, like, one hour of sleep.
>
> But you're high on endorphins.
>
> And you go up to that coffee machine.
>
> You press the button.
>
> You get yourself a cup of coffee.
>
> You lift it to your face.
>
> And that's when it hits you.
>
> The smell.
>
> Now, I know that's kind of shocking.
>
> But it is true.
>
> Because if a guy likes you...
>
> He's going to be like...
>
> I am a man.
>
> I'm going to get some more of this.
>
> But if a guy likes you, he's going to be on that coffee...
>
> Oh, fuck!
>
> What the fuck is this?
>
> Someone please cut off my hand.
>
> You know, and for me, I have a beard.
>
> You know, it takes days for me to wash that shit.
>
> It's like I'm walking around in this pussy helmet.
>
> And if I don't like you...
>
> We're not going to talk again.
>
> So here's my advice to women.
>
> It's like on the day after you've had sex,
>
> you've got to do something,
>
> which I know for most of this generation is very hard
>
> because you like texting.
>
> You've got to call him.
>
> You call the guy.
>
> And you'd be like, hey, how are you doing?
>
> Listen, I'm just calling quickly
>
> because, you know, you left something at my place.
>
> You forgot your phone charger.
>
> And he's going to have his phone up near his face.
>
> And so he's telling the truth because he can smell it.
>
> And he's going to be like, if he likes you,
>
> he's going to be, yeah, well, thank you.
>
> You know, maybe I can come around this evening
>
> and charge up my phone.
>
> But if he doesn't like you, he's going to be like,
>
> yeah, you know, don't worry about it, you know,
>
> because I'm getting a new phone anyway.
>
> This one kind of stinks.
>
> It's over there.
>
> But the good news is,
>
> at least you can get over it quickly.
>
> So, you know, that's my message to you.
>
> You guys, you smell great.
>
> Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> Harry doing some clean comedy for you guys.
>
> Very nice.
>
> Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> we only have three comics left,
>
> and these guys are great.
>
> I want to bring up the next one without any further ado.
>
> Here he is, everybody.
>
> Adrian Faulkner, give it up!
