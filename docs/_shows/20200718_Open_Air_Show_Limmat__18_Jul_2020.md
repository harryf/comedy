> And that brings us to our very last act of tonight, okay?
>
> Everybody focus, everybody in.
>
> I know people have been jumping into the water
>
> this whole time, you know.
>
> Somebody's telling a good joke,
>
> "Yeah, I used to be on an airplane."
>
> Kind of hard to keep the concentration,
>
> but we're ready now for our last comedian of tonight.
>
> And this guy, he is actually originally British,
>
> but he's been living here in Switzerland
>
> for the past 17 years.
>
> And yes, this is his real name.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Harry Fox,
>
> ladies and gentlemen.
>
> It's Harry Fox.
>
> - Hey, and thanks.
>
> Give it up for Amit as well
>
> for organizing such a fantastic night tonight.
>
> This guy has worked hard for this.
>
> Wow.
>
> I mean, wow.
>
> Like, this is such a great night, you know.
>
> You got a river, you got an open sky,
>
> you got a giant concrete penis over there.
>
> That's wonderful.
>
> Nadine, you hate gray buildings, don't you?
>
> This must, this has been a very traumatic night for you.
>
> I feel you, you know.
>
> Hopefully you'll be able to forget about this by tomorrow.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in the open air with a bunch of English speakers
>
> and I say this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halver and Wather.
>
> Just to, okay, we need some processing, that joke.
>
> Just work on that.
>
> No, the real problem with the name, my Harry Fuchs,
>
> is actually, if I can just say,
>
> there just simply hasn't been enough fucking in my life.
>
> And in fact, you know, you can see I'm quite old.
>
> And even at this age,
>
> I honestly don't know if I'm any good at sex.
>
> 'Cause I read recently that to be good at anything,
>
> it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> Wow.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> I mean, maybe, if I add it all up,
>
> maybe I get to 5,000 hours if I include masturbation.
>
> But, you know, what makes this,
>
> I actually did some more maths on this.
>
> Did you know that you actually need to fuck 24 hours a day
>
> for an entire year to get to just 8,000 hours?
>
> Wow.
>
> And if you live to 70,
>
> you need to fuck 10 times a day
>
> from the day you were born until the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse about that,
>
> the thought of newborn babies having sex
>
> or the idea of sex with old people
>
> on the day they're dying.
>
> It's a terrible thought.
>
> But you know what makes this even worse is like,
>
> as I stand here like watching all of you wasting time
>
> listening to me,
>
> I know that all of you must suck at sex too.
>
> Wow.
>
> Oh, of course, except for Alan,
>
> 'cause he has big data on spanking.
>
> Give it up for Alan over there and his spanking.
>
> Yeah.
>
> So what am I gonna do next?
>
> Let's take a little look.
>
> You know, actually, I'm telling you some dark things.
>
> Let's try and lift this up.
>
> I get inspired.
>
> You know, sometimes when I see a happy couple
>
> that are really in love,
>
> like Anna and Floris over there.
>
> What a great couple, aren't they wonderful?
>
> Give it up for Anna and Floris.
>
> Because, you know, Floris,
>
> before he got into this relationship,
>
> he was like a mean fighting machine, like an attack dog.
>
> He had all his surgery knives.
>
> He was a rough guy.
>
> And then Anna looked at him and thought,
>
> hmm, I wonder what I can do to turn Floris into a poodle
>
> so I can take him to brunch and show him off to my friends
>
> and go, oh, look what I did with this little doggie woggie.
>
> Isn't he cute?
>
> Look at this little ribbon.
>
> He doesn't even shit behind the curtains anymore.
>
> It's great.
>
> Floris, should we fix this quickly?
>
> Come on, give it with me.
>
> Give me that aww.
>
> Oh, Jesus Christ, man.
>
> Floris is deep in this.
>
> Okay, good luck, Floris.
>
> All right, so I'm single.
>
> Has anyone been on a Tinder date here?
>
> They're all in denial.
>
> This is great.
>
> I don't do Tinder.
>
> Yes, I do.
>
> All right, look, for you guys,
>
> Tinder isn't such a bad thing
>
> 'cause you're all kind of young and cute.
>
> For me, for me, Tinder is a dark place
>
> because I have to do older Tinder.
>
> Do you know what that means?
>
> That means I have to swipe my way through broken marriages,
>
> drug and alcohol problems, faded tattoos saying,
>
> no regrets, it's brutal.
>
> And you know what the scariest thing,
>
> the scariest thing on older Tinder?
>
> It's the sight of a 50-year-old woman making a duck face.
>
> I mean, how the fuck do you get to be 50
>
> and think that a duck face is okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is ever okay
>
> is when both your parents are ducks.
>
> And ducks actually only live about 10 years.
>
> The universe has no place for a 50-year-old duck face.
>
> Okay, except for you, ma'am.
>
> You can do some duck face later.
>
> Maybe I'll hook up with Ann that week.
>
> Yeah, wow.
>
> Oh my God.
>
> Wow, you've got some great genes
>
> that you've inherited here.
>
> They'd be very happy with that.
>
> But don't do duck face, madam.
>
> That's 80, I think.
>
> So where are we going?
>
> Yeah, but I don't know.
>
> I mean, I guess one of the things
>
> that's tricky on social media these days,
>
> especially for women, is the danger of dick pics.
>
> Because I read this statistic recently
>
> that almost 50% of men between 20 and 40
>
> send a dick pic in the last six months.
>
> I'm just looking around here.
>
> Steve is looking a bit dick picky over there.
>
> I don't know.
>
> That's a guy who comes alone to a comedy night.
>
> I'm just handing out dick pics.
>
> But, you know, ladies,
>
> that might be a hard number to visualize,
>
> but I'll mansplain this for you, if you'll excuse me.
>
> If you give your number to 10 guys here tonight,
>
> by Christmas time,
>
> you got a stack of five dicks on your phone.
>
> You can just print them out,
>
> use them as Christmas cards, hang them from your tree.
>
> Steve's dick at the top of your tree will look great.
>
> Yeah, but let's change the topic.
>
> Let's get off dicks for a second.
>
> Yeah, so lady, yellow dress lady,
>
> you'll we go to you for,
>
> what is your favorite sea animal?
>
> What is the greatest sea animal that you can think of?
>
> You've gone blank.
>
> Oh, shark.
>
> I was just about to say, good, good choice.
>
> Sharks, they're mean, but you're wrong.
>
> The greatest sea animal is the Argonaut octopus.
>
> I found out about this recently.
>
> This animal is incredible.
>
> Now to explain this, I'm gonna do my David Attenborough voice
>
> because when the male Argonaut octopus spots a female,
>
> he detaches his penis.
>
> It swims through the water and homes in on her vagina.
>
> Sorry, not your vagina, madam.
>
> Sorry about that.
>
> No, I shit you not.
>
> This is, in layman's terms,
>
> there is an octopus out there
>
> with a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> This thing is incredible.
>
> Google that shit, it's real.
>
> And it got me thinking, like, you know,
>
> what would happen if human beings had detachable penises?
>
> That would be crazy.
>
> This lady's going, oh, fuck.
>
> Yeah, I mean, you know, we'd start,
>
> probably we'd have, like, dick-related sports, you know?
>
> You'd have, like, dick racing at the Olympics.
>
> You got the decathlon.
>
> Nike changes its slogan to just dick it.
>
> And you'd have to learn how to deal
>
> with, like, a detachable dick.
>
> Like, what if you lost your dick?
>
> Wow, that would be crazy.
>
> You'd just have to hope you got an app on your phone,
>
> find my penis.
>
> Could you borrow your friend's dick?
>
> I wasn't cheating, it was his dick.
>
> But I mean, you know, we talked about dick pics before.
>
> Flying dicks, that would be terrible, you know?
>
> Can you imagine that would be,
>
> like, take Nadine, for example, again, you know?
>
> She's, it's Monday morning.
>
> She's on the way to wherever she's going,
>
> just, like, hating all the great buildings around,
>
> just getting stressed.
>
> And suddenly, bam, this dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She, like, ducks down behind some old ladies
>
> just to throw it off.
>
> She gets down, she pulls out her dick shield
>
> like Captain America.
>
> Dicks are flying all around, hitting the shield.
>
> She's like, "Oh, fuck, the tram arrives."
>
> She jumps in, she gets to wherever she is
>
> to work or university or something.
>
> And luckily, there's a sign saying,
>
> "Please keep your penis attached during office hours."
>
> All right, that's what I've got for you tonight.
>
> You guys have been a lot of fun.
>
> Give it up to yourselves.
>
> It's been a great night.
>
> Thank you so much.
>
> I'm flying out of here.
>
> Yes!
>
> And we've made it to the end of the show tonight.
>
> Thank you all so much.
