> He leads us to our very last act of tonight, okay?
>
> Everybody focus, everybody in.
>
> I know people have been jumping into the water this whole time, you know.
>
> Somebody's telling a joke, like, yeah, I used to be on an airplane.
>
> It's kind of hard to keep the concentration, but we're ready now for our last
>
> comedian of tonight.
>
> And this guy, he is actually originally British, but he's been living here in
>
> Switzerland for the past 17 years.
>
> And yes, this is his real name.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> It's Harry Fox.
>
> Hey, and thanks.
>
> Give it up for Amit as well for organizing such a fantastic night tonight.
>
> This guy has worked hard for this.
>
> Wow.
>
> I mean, wow.
>
> Like, this is such a great night.
>
> You know, you got a river, you got an open sky, you got a giant concrete penis
>
> over there.
>
> That's wonderful.
>
> Nadine, you hate gray bills.
>
> Don't you?
>
> This must, this has been a very traumatic night for you.
>
> I feel you, you know.
>
> Hopefully, you'll be able to forget about this by tomorrow.
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in the open air with a bunch of English speakers like this, a lot
>
> of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when
>
> you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them how-the and what-the.
>
> Just to, okay, we need some processing, that joke.
>
> Just work on that.
>
> No, the real problem with the name Harry Fox is actually, if I can just say,
>
> there just simply hasn't been enough fucking in my life.
>
> And in fact, you know, you can see I'm quite old.
>
> And even at this age, I honestly don't know if I'm any good at sex.
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> Wow.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> I mean, maybe, if I add it all up, maybe I get to 5,000 hours if I include
>
> masturbation.
>
> But, you know, what makes this, I actually did some more maths on this.
>
> Did you know that you actually need to fuck 24 hours a day for an entire year
>
> to get to just 8,000 hours?
>
> Wow.
>
> And if you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were
>
> born until the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse about that.
>
> The thought of newborn babies.
>
> Babies having sex.
>
> Or the idea of sex with old people on the day they're dying.
>
> It's a terrible thought.
>
> But you know what makes this even worse?
>
> It's like, as I stand here, like, watching all of you wasting time listening to
>
> me,
>
> I know that all of you must suck at sex too.
>
> Wow.
>
> Of course, except for Alan.
>
> Because he has big data on spanking.
>
> Give it up for Alan over there and his spanking.
>
> Yeah, so what am I going to do next?
>
> Let's take a little look.
>
> You know, actually, I'm telling you some dark things.
>
> Let's try and lift this up.
>
> I get inspired, you know, sometimes when I see a happy couple that are really
>
> in love,
>
> like Anna and Floris over there.
>
> What a great couple.
>
> Aren't they wonderful?
>
> Give it up for Anna and Floris.
>
> Because, you know, Floris, before he got into this relationship, he was like a
>
> mean fighting machine,
>
> like an attack dog.
>
> He had all his surgery knives.
>
> He was a rough guy.
>
> And then Anna looked at him and thought, "Hmm, I wonder what I can do to turn
>
> Floris into a poodle,
>
> so I can take him to brunch and show him off to my friends and go,
>
> 'Oh, look what I did with this little doggy-woggy.
>
> Isn't he cute?
>
> Look at this little ribbon.
>
> He doesn't even shit behind the curtains anymore.
>
> It's great.'"
>
> Floris, should we fix this quickly?
>
> Come on, give it with me.
>
> Give me that aww.
>
> Oh, Jesus Christ, man.
>
> Floris is deep in this.
>
> Okay, good luck, Floris.
>
> All right.
>
> So I'm single.
>
> Has anyone been on a Tinder date here?
>
> They're all in denial.
>
> This is great.
>
> I don't do Tinder.
>
> Yes, I do.
>
> All right.
>
> Look, for you guys, Tinder isn't such a bad thing because you're all kind of
>
> young and cute.
>
> For me, for me, Tinder is a dark place because I have to do all the Tinder.
>
> Do you know what that means?
>
> That means I have to swipe my way through broken marriages, drug and alcohol
>
> problems,
>
> faded tattoos saying, "No regrets."
>
> It's brutal.
>
> And you know what the scariest thing, the scariest thing on all the Tinder?
>
> It's the sight of a 50-year-old woman making a duck face.
>
> I mean, how the fuck do you get to be?
>
> 50 and think that a duck face is okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is ever okay is when both your parents are ducks.
>
> And ducks actually only live about 10 years.
>
> The universe has no place for a 50-year-old duck face.
>
> Okay, except for you, ma'am.
>
> You can do some duck face later.
>
> Maybe I'll hook up with Ahmed.
>
> Yeah.
>
> Wow.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> Wow.
>
> You've got some great genes that you've inherited here.
>
> They'd be very happy with that.
>
> But don't do duck face, madam.
>
> That's 80, I think.
>
> So where are we going?
>
> Yeah.
>
> But I don't know.
>
> I mean, I guess one of the things that's tricky on social media these days,
>
> especially for
>
> women, is the danger of dick pics.
>
> Because I read the statistic recently that almost 50% of men between 20 and 40
>
> sent a
>
> dick pic in the last six months.
>
> I'm just looking around here.
>
> Steve is looking a bit dick pic-y over there.
>
> I don't know.
>
> That's a guy who comes alone to a comedy night.
>
> I'm just handing out dick pics.
>
> But, you know, ladies, that might be a hard number to visualize, but I'll mansplain
>
> this
>
> for you, if you'll excuse me.
>
> If you give your number to 10 guys here tonight, by Christmas time, you've got
>
> a stack of five
>
> dicks on your phone.
>
> You can just print them out, use them as Christmas cards.
