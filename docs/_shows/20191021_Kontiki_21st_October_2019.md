> of the night. All right, all right. That was what I was hoping for.
>
> It's not worth it. Let's try that again.
>
> He's one of the sexiest people
>
> that does Swiss comedy. So one more time, please welcome to the stage, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> Mr. Harry Fox.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in this room of English speakers, you'll think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux.
>
> And in my family, we get very upset when we have a family get-together.
>
> And you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halba and Watba.
>
> But the problem with a name like Harry Fux is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And, you know, if my name was actually Harry Fux, I would have come on stage here tonight and been
>
> like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fux in the house!"
>
> But that's not really me. I'm kind of quiet.
>
> And, you know, sometimes people say stupid things to me.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up to me because, you know, Americans are stupid.
>
> He's not going to react over that.
>
> And he came up and he said, "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fux. Harry Fux what, man?"
>
> I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "Exactly. Harry Fux what?"
>
> And I'm like, "I don't know. Let me throw him off with some adverbs."
>
> Like, Harry Fux hopefully.
>
> Harry Fux occasionally.
>
> Harry does fuck enthusiastically.
>
> He's like, "No, man. No. Harry Fux goats, man. Harry Fux chickens. Harry Fux tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And it actually made me realize that there is a whole category of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like take hippos, for example. You may get up behind a hippo and think, "Hmm, that is a sweet ass."
>
> Don't do it. Because hippos are the most dangerous land animal.
>
> They kill about 500 people every year in Africa.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Or elephants, you know. Elephants, because it's just too high up.
>
> Can't reach.
>
> But maybe if the mum isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> Alright, okay. I'm just finding your level. I see you're okay with bestiality.
>
> Not pedophile bestiality.
>
> I'll try and stay away from that.
>
> But let me just share. I'm having a bit of a hard time at the moment.
>
> Because, honestly, let me share that it's been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Can I give you my number?
>
> Shit, shit, that's what happens to me.
>
> But put your hand up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Come on, you three guys.
>
> Did you have sex together before this?
>
> No, they haven't had sex.
>
> Okay, for the rest of you, I didn't realise tonight is the Zurich Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meet-up.
>
> So to help you understand my situation.
>
> When you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be walking down the street.
>
> You see a couple...
>
> Someone needs to take care of this lady.
>
> I'll do it for you.
>
> You could be walking down the street.
>
> You see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> You look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Negro and you spot a special offer on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's getting hot, it's getting steamy, you're oblivious to all the people watching you.
>
> And then you hear this voice saying, "Junge Mann, schämen Sie sich nicht!"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you look at her and think, "She's nice."
>
> That's how it is.
>
> Actually, at the moment, it's not just hard for me, it's hard for women when it comes to dating.
>
> I read this statistic recently and it said that in the age range 20 to 40,
>
> in the last three months, almost 50% of men sent a dick pic to somebody.
>
> That's an incredible number.
>
> Daniela, did Alex send you a dick pic?
>
> I mean, when I look at that hairstyle, I'm getting big dick energy.
>
> Are you sure? What about you, Anna? No dick pics?
>
> It's very disappointing. Well, these are some good guys.
>
> But maybe for the rest of you ladies, 50% is a hard number to visualize.
>
> So let me help you with that.
>
> If you gave your number to ten guys in this room,
>
> at Christmas time, you have a stack of five dicks on your phone.
>
> And you can print them out, use them as Christmas cards, hang them from your Christmas tree.
>
> There's so much you can do.
>
> Personally, though, I don't send dick pics myself.
>
> That's not because I'm better than that, but it's because taking a quality dick pic is hard.
>
> There's a lot to think about.
>
> You've got the lighting, do we go for some mellow tones to bring out the fleshy colors?
>
> Something more red and erotic.
>
> What about props? Do I need to put some roses around here, make it a bit romantic?
>
> Kind of danger of pricking my dick? I don't know.
>
> But the hardest part is the angle, because it's a selfie.
>
> Do you take it from here, or here, or under there?
>
> I don't know. But luckily, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> That's why I invented the Dick Pic Selfie Stick.
>
> You can get it on dickpicselfiesick.com tonight, $29.99 special offer to all of you.
>
> Alright, so, as we have a lot of people here from Tinder and Bumble,
>
> I thought maybe I'd just tell you a bit more about my dating life.
>
> I was in a long-term relationship for almost 20 years.
>
> And then, for the last year or so, I've been single.
>
> Being single is hard, but I thought maybe Tinder could be the answer.
>
> How wrong I was.
>
> Because 20 years ago, we didn't have Tinder.
>
> But now, for you guys on these dates, Tinder is an amazing place.
>
> Because you get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies and potential erotic encounters.
>
> And the dream that your perfect guy, your prince, might be in here.
>
> But for me, Tinder over 40 is a dark place.
>
> I have to swipe my way through broken marriages, drug and alcohol problems,
>
> faded tattoos saying, "No regrets!"
>
> It's brutal.
>
> And it makes me wonder, like, ladies, what happens to you in the next 10 to 15 years
>
> that leads to your lives being ruined?
>
> Is it that prince, like Alex, you find once in a while?
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> Because, you know, the hard part about all the Tinder, though,
>
> is that all the women, they're oddly specific about what they don't want in their next relationship.
>
> Because, like, swipe left, they go, "Swipe left if you hate my children."
>
> "Swipe left if you're planning to run off with my sister."
>
> "Swipe left if you fantasize about adult diapers."
>
> Yeah, it's really tough stuff.
>
> But, you know, to me, the scariest thing, the scariest thing about all the Tinder
>
> is the sight of a 50-year-old woman making a duck face.
>
> I mean, how the fuck do you get to 50 and still think that duck faces are still okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is ever okay is if both your parents are ducks.
>
> And ducks actually only live about 10 years.
>
> The universe had no place for 50-year-old duck face.
>
> But recently, I got a message from a lady.
>
> She was 52.
>
> And she said, "With those cute blue eyes, how is it you are still running around free?"
>
> Now, for her, that was an "ah," for me, that was a "what the fuck?"
>
> Because that is the worst pick-up line I've ever heard.
>
> Can you imagine if I said that to any woman here?
>
> "You shouldn't be running around free."
>
> "You should be tied up in my dungeon."
>
> It's completely fucked up.
>
> And what it made me realize is that all the women,
>
> all the women, they don't really know how to chat up men.
>
> Because all these years, men have been making all the effort.
>
> Men have been coming up to them.
>
> But now, men aren't showing so much interest because things are getting a bit saggy.
>
> And so, they have zero game.
>
> And the other thing that I read is that as women get older, they actually get hornier.
>
> So as you get older, your sex drive increases.
>
> So that means they have zero game, they're super horny,
>
> and no one really wants to fuck them.
>
> I know, it's terrible, but I thought, "I can fix this."
>
> All I need is to find another group that has zero game,
>
> is super horny, and that no one wants to fuck.
>
> Teenage boys.
>
> We need an app for the older ladies.
>
> We call it Teendar.
>
> Alright, I think on this dark note, I'm probably done here.
>
> You good?
>
> Yeah.
>
> Alright, Harry Fox, everyone.
>
> Thank you, guys.
>
> Alright.
>
> Teendar.
>
> Get on it, you guys.
>
> You know what you're doing.
>
> Medical science people, you can take care of that for us, right?
>
> Lucian's already making it.
>
> Alright, we made it to the end.
>
> You guys have been a fucking amazing audience.
>
> Thank you for staying to the end of that.
>
> ZigZag, you guys were brilliant.
>
> This show is here every Tuesday night.
>
> Every Tuesday you can come back, bring him on the second date.
>
> Maybe, who knows?
>
> Alright, I got hopes for you guys.
