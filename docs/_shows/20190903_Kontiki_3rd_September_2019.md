> You think funny, do you know what I mean?
>
> You can say anything, "Ah, my tambourine is like a mozzarella, you can stretch
>
> it out."
>
> "I do a 69 and eat this ballsack like gelato."
>
> Okay, Italians, do you know what you think? Do you like Ludovica?
>
> I don't know her, I don't know her.
>
> Do you think she represented Italy well?
>
> She was amazing.
>
> Okay, what about you, did you also have a good for Italy, or were you like...
>
> No, I think I'm gonna have pizza problems after this.
>
> A lot of mozzarella tops, okay.
>
> Okay, so, let's bring up our last act of the first half, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> he gets his own music.
>
> I love this guy, ladies and gentlemen, he does a bunch of comedy with us, and
>
> this is in fact his real name.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up, last performer of the half is Harry Fox, give
>
> it up!
>
> Okay, let's just make some space here.
>
> So, tonight I want to try something a bit different, I want to try a social
>
> experiment.
>
> Are you guys up for a social experiment?
>
> No, seriously, are you guys up for a social experiment?
>
> Okay, this one isn't, but okay, so...
>
> This is a box of negro cherry tomatoes.
>
> So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over here and give you these tomatoes, can
>
> you please take one and pass it on?
>
> Some of them got a bit crushed, it feels a bit weird in there, but don't worry,
>
> it's just, it's honestly tomato juice.
>
> Now, you can do anything you want with these tomatoes, you can eat it, you can
>
> give it to someone you like, you can throw it at someone you hate.
>
> Now, while you're passing out the tomatoes, let me tell you a little story.
>
> I want to tell you the story of Amina.
>
> Amina is a wonderful little nine-year-old girl, she's so full of love and
>
> laughter and happiness, but unfortunately, Amina lives in famine-stricken South
>
> Sudan.
>
> And every night when Amina goes to bed, she goes to bed hungry, and probably,
>
> this is terrible, the chances that she'll live to 15 are very small.
>
> But Amina wanted me to give you these tomatoes.
>
> Because, you know, she wanted to bring some joy to the people in Switzerland
>
> that have so much.
>
> And Amina, of course, would be very sad to hear of tomatoes getting wasted.
>
> Okay, so while you keep that in mind, let's get on with the show.
>
> So, yep, as Ahmed said, my name is Harry Fuchs, Harry Fuchs.
>
> And the problem with this name is I have a lot of problems with women, you know.
>
> And, you know, I think the problem is that when I get into women, it makes them
>
> nervous.
>
> And I find that really hard because I think women are fantastic.
>
> And by coincidence, women think I'm fantastic, too.
>
> And, you know, and sometimes when I think about this, I think this is why it
>
> makes me nervous.
>
> And it makes me sad, and I go home after work, and I'm feeling down, and I
>
> think, "What is wrong with me?"
>
> You know, "What is wrong?"
>
> And I think about it.
>
> And, of course, I find absolutely nothing.
>
> It's just perfection here.
>
> And then I go to bed, and I have a long sleep like a newborn baby.
>
> And I wake up in the morning, and if I'm still feeling sad, I just go in the
>
> bathroom.
>
> I look at myself in the mirror, and I'm immediately uplifted just to see so
>
> much perfection.
>
> Oh, hold on a second. Wait, I'm getting a call.
>
> Oh, hi, Amina.
>
> How are you doing?
>
> Yeah, yeah, I gave them the cherry tomatoes.
>
> They're really happy.
>
> They're full of gratitude.
>
> Yeah, okay.
>
> All right, thank you.
>
> Have a good evening.
>
> All right, let's carry on with the show.
>
> Let's carry on with this social experiment.
>
> Because, look, honestly, I'm not saying that I'm better than women, you know?
>
> I mean, I probably am.
>
> I mean, I definitely am better than all women ever.
>
> You know, like my last girlfriend, for example, Susan, she said to me, "Harry
>
> Fox, you have commitment issues."
>
> And I said, "Ah, it's not the first time I hear that today."
>
> And Susan said, "Harry Fox, do you even love me?"
>
> And I said, "Of course I love you. How could you say that, Sarah?"
>
> You know, that's hard.
>
> And, you know, I'm interested, though, that so far, Amina, you're on Amina's
>
> side.
>
> Not a single tomato has come my direction.
>
> That's great.
>
> I'm enjoying this so far.
>
> We have a bit of a cowardly crowd here.
>
> Who will throw the first note?
>
> It's not going to happen.
>
> Maybe you just don't hate me enough yet.
>
> You know, the thing is, like, sometimes I just look up to the sky and I'm like,
>
> "Why?
>
> Why did you make me this so perfect?"
>
> Congratulations.
>
> It was a bit of a girly throw, though.
>
> You're welcome.
>
> No, that's OK.
>
> That's two.
>
> All right.
>
> Keep going.
>
> No, but, you know, you know what the thing is, though?
>
> The funny thing is about sociopaths.
>
> They say sociopaths lack empathy for other people.
>
> Some people even say, "I might be a sociopath."
>
> But that's ridiculous because I have a little bit of empathy for other people.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I don't know.
>
> I'm not sure.
>
> a sociopath. But that's ridiculous because I have a lot of empathy and sympathy
>
> for all
>
> the lesser beings. Women. I'm done here. You can now toss my salad. Let's get
>
> the fuck
>
> out of here. Give it up for Harry Potter, ladies and gentlemen. Please don't
>
> waste
>
> Amina's food here. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that was our first half. Stick
>
> around, we've
>
> got so much more amazing comedy.
