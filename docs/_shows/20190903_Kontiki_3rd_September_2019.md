>

>
> You can stretch it out.

>

>
> Do you think she represented Italy well?
>
> Italy was amazing.
>
> Okay, what about you?

>

>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.
>
> Last performer of the half is Harry Fox.
>
> Give it up.
>
> Okay.
>
> Let's just make some space here.
>
> So, tonight I want to try something a bit different.
>
> I want to try a social experiment.
>
> Are you guys up for a social experiment?
>
> No, seriously.
>
> Are you guys up for a social experiment?
>
> Yeah!
>
> Okay, this one isn't, but okay.
>
> So, this is a box of negro cherry tomatoes.
>
> So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over here and give you these
>
> tomatoes.
>
> Can you please take one and pass it on?
>
> Some of them go a bit crushed.
>
> It feels a bit weird in there, but don't worry.
>
> It's just, it's honestly tomato juice.
>
> Now, you can do anything you want with these tomatoes.
>
> You can eat it.
>
> You can give it to someone you like.
>
> You can throw it at someone you hate.
>
> Now, while you're passing out the tomatoes, let me tell you a little story.
>
> I want to tell you the story of Amina.
>
> Amina is a wonderful little nine-year-old girl.
>
> She's so full of love and laughter and happiness.
>
> But, unfortunately, Amina lives in famine-stricken South Sudan.
>
> And every night when Amina goes to bed, she goes to bed hungry.
>
> And probably, this is terrible, the chances that she'll live to 15 are very
>
> small.
>
> But Amina wanted me to give you these tomatoes tonight.
>
> Because, you know, she wanted to bring some joy to the people in Switzerland
>
> that have so much.
>
> And Amina, of course, would be very sad to hear of tomatoes getting wasted.
>
> Okay, so why do you keep that in mind?
>
> Let's get on with the show.
>
> So, yeah, as I said, my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> Harry Fuchs.
>
> And the problem with this name is I have a lot of problems with women, you know.
>
> And I think the problem is that when I get near women, it makes them nervous.
>
> And I find that really hard because I think women are fantastic.
>
> And by coincidence, women think I'm fantastic, too.
>
> And, you know, sometimes when I think about this, I think this is why it makes
>
> me nervous.
>
> And it makes me sad and I go home after work and I'm feeling down.
>
> What is wrong with me?
>
> You know, what is wrong?
>
> And I think about it and, of course, I find absolutely nothing.
>
> It's just perfection here.
>
> And then I go to bed and I have a long sleep like a newborn baby.
>
> And I wake up in the morning and if I'm still feeling sad, I just go in the
>
> bathroom.
>
> I look at myself in the mirror and I'm immediately uplifted just to see so much
>
> perfection.
>
> Hold on a second, wait, I'm getting a call.
>
> Oh, hi, Amina.
>
> How are you doing?
>
> Yeah, yeah, I gave them the cherry tomatoes.
>
> They're really happy.
>
> They're full of gratitude.
>
> Yeah, okay, all right, thank you.
>
> Have a good evening.
>
> All right, let's carry on with the show.
>
> Let's carry on with this social experiment.
>
> Because, look, honestly, I'm not saying that I'm better than women, you know?
>
> I mean, I probably am.
>
> I mean, I definitely am better than all women ever.
>
> You know, like my last girlfriend, for example, Susan, she said to me, "Harry
>
> Fox, you have commitment issues."
>
> And I said, "Ah, it's not the first time I hear that."
>
> Today.
>
> And Susan said, "Harry Fox, do you even love me?"
>
> And I said, "Of course I love you.
>
> How could you say that, Sarah?"
>
> You know, that's hard.
>
> And, you know, I'm interested, though, that so far, Amina, you're on Amina's
>
> side.
>
> Not a single tomato has come my direction.
>
> That's great.
>
> I'm enjoying this so far.
>
> We have a bit of a cowardly crowd here.
>
> Who will throw the first?
>
> No, it's not going to happen.
>
> Maybe you just don't hate me enough yet.
>
> You know, the thing is, like, sometimes I just look up to the sky and I'm like,
>
> "Why?
>
> Why did you make me this so perfect?"
>
> Congratulations.
>
> It was a bit of a girly throw, though.
>
> You're welcome.
>
> No, that's okay.
>
> That's two.
>
> All right.
>
> Keep going.
>
> No, but, you know, you know what the thing is, though?
>
> The funny thing is about sociopaths.
>
> They say sociopaths lack empathy for other people.
>
> Some people even say I might be a sociopath.
>
> But that's ridiculous because I have a lot of empathy and sympathy for all the
>
> lesser beings.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> Congratulations.
>
> All right.
>
> I'm done here.
>
> You can now toss my salad.
>
> Let's get the fuck out of here.
>
> Give it up for Harry Potter, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Please don't waste Amina's food here.
>
> Okay.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, that was our first half.
>
> Stick around.
>
> We've got so much more amazing comedy.
