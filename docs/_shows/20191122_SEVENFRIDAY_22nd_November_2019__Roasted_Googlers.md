>
> name is Harry Fox
>
> my name is not Harry Fox and in my family when we have a family get-together
>
> we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers and I have two kids I had to call them Halva
>
> and Watha
>
> no but the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is I get a lot of stupid
>
> comments you know
>
> like like recently this American tourist came up to me and he's like
>
> yo what's up man Harry Fox Harry Fox what man
>

>
> Harry Fox goats man Harry Fox chickens Harry Fox tigers
>
> now I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind no one has ever
>
> successfully fucked a tiger
>
> in fact this guy made me realize that there is a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals
>
> like take hippos for example now you may get up behind a hippo and think wow
>
> that is a sweet ass
>
> don't do it
>
> because hippos they are the most dangerous land mammals they kill about 500
>
> people every year
>
> do not fuck with hippos
>
> or elephants you know because you know it's just too high up you can't reach
>
> but you know if the mum isn't looking you could probably fuck a baby elephant
>
> all right I'm sorry I'm just finding your level I understand you're okay with
>
> bestiality but not pedophile bestiality
>
> all right I'm sorry I'm just finding your level I understand you're okay with
>
> bestiality but not pedophile bestiality
>
> all right I'm sorry I'm just finding your level I understand you're okay with

>
> all right I'm sorry I'm just finding your level I understand you're okay with
>
> bestiality but not pedophile bestiality
>
> to you. I'll try and stay away from that for you, man. So, you know, I recently,
>
> let me tell you a
>
> story. So I recently got on Instagram and, you know, that took a long time
>
> because I always
>
> thought that Instagram was a festering cesspool of narcissists and sociopaths.
>
> And then I thought,
>
> wait a second, these are my people. Oh my God. But, you know, I do realize
>
> though that maybe I'm
>
> a bit too old for Instagram because some things I really have a problem with,
>
> like inspirational
>
> quotes. Oh my God. When I see inspirational quotes, I just fill up with rage
>
> and my brain just puts
>
> these subtitles underneath. And if you guys could see those subtitles,
>
> Instagram would be a whole
>
> lot less inspirational. For example, be yourself. There's no one
>
> better. Yeah, 7 billion people might disagree with that. If you can't find the
>
> sunshine,
>
> be the sunshine. Yeah, I know. Because they clearly cause skin cancer. Or, I
>
> don't know,
>
> just like living my best life. If that's your best life, maybe it needs to stop.
>
> I'm smarter, not harder. Okay, you just got fired. Like a boss of a McDonald's
>
> in Dubendorf.
>
> They said I couldn't, and that's why I did. And that is why you're serving 15
>
> to life.
>
> Friends are the family you get to choose.
>
> What, so if we fuck, it's incest? Or, you know, like, the way you talk to
>
> yourself matters
>
> the most. So maybe you should shut the fuck up. Or, if life hands you lemons,
>
> make lemonade.
>
> Or go to Migros and buy a bag of oranges. All right, so that's Instagram. Let
>
> me switch to
>
> another app.
>
> But this is an app that I love. Uber. I mean, Uber is amazing, you know.
>
> Because Uber gets
>
> you out of the terrible pain of having to lift your arm to your head and say
>
> those awful
>
> words, "Can you send a taxi, please?" Uber gets rid of that. But what's really
>
> amazing
>
> about Uber is Uber will get you out of anything. No one argues with Uber. For
>
> example, you're
>
> going to get a taxi. It sucks. You know, there's just feldschloss and paprika
>
> chips, you know,
>
> like every Swiss house party ever. And you're like, I just want to watch
>
> Netflix. One tap.
>
> Oh, sorry, guys. My Uber's downstairs. Cheers. Gets you right out of there. Or,
>
> you know,
>
> you're walking down the street. You meet some friend that you haven't seen
>
> since kindergarten,
>
> and they start to tell you their life story, and you're like, oh, I can't
>
> believe this.
>
> Uber's just around the corner. See you in ten years. Or you're in a miserable
>
> relationship.
>
> You both hate each other. One tap. Okay, darling, ciao. I'm out of here. You'll
>
> see you in the
>
> divorce hearings. That's what Uber will do for you.
>
> But, you know, I do wonder, I do wonder where did Uber get its name from?
>
> Because Uber was
>
> founded by two guys called Travis and Garrett. And Travis was probably like, we
>
> need a name
>
> for this app that says we're better. Let's go with something simple like "above."
>
> And
>
> Garrett was like, no, it's got something, but let's make it more sexy, more
>
> European.
>
> Let's call it Uber. Because those Germans know something about elitism. Yeah.
>
> And so,
>
> you know, and it makes me actually wonder, like, if I could travel back in time
>
> to Berlin
>
> and say to him, I'd probably be like, yo, Adolf, things aren't going to go very
>
> well
>
> for you in the next few months, but you would not believe what they call the
>
> taxi app of
>
> the future. Okay, now I don't want to ruin Uber for you, because, because I
>
> know how
>
> it feels. You know, when you get in that Uber, it's just like a, oh, thank God.
>
> Thank God
>
> I'm not on that S-Bahn to Dubendorf. Just, just squashed in there with lots of
>
> other people, nowhere to sit. Yeah, it's fucked up. Like, how is it? How is it
>
> that we, you
>
> know, there's corporations, I won't name this particular corporation over here,
>
> corporations
>
> dominating the planet. It's not okay that they do it with fascist product names.
>
> I mean,
>
> imagine I was to design an app for those CrossFit fanatics, you know? It's like
>
> an app for when
>
> you've been, you've got to hang over, you've got to get the toxins out. I come
>
> up with
>
> this app, and Garret comes up to me. He's like, "Sweat out. Let's make it more
>
> sexy,
>
> more European. Let's call this Auschwitz." Oh my God. Holy shit. And then you've
>
> got
>
> those dudes on Instagram just doing their workout going, "Auschwitzing. It's
>
> wrong.
>
> We've got to stop this." Okay, but the Googlers here are very happy because I
>
> didn't do anything
>
> about a Google product. You're safe with me. Okay. Let's, let's, let's change
>
> tack a bit.
>
> So do we have any PhD students? Like Lorenzo, do you, do you have, do you have
>
> a PhD to
>
> work in Atlanta? Well, let me, but you, you've already qualified or you're, you're
>
> still
>
> doing it? No, I finished out there, so. You finished long ago, but, well, let's,
>
> oh, at
>
> the ETH, that's perfect. Because let's, let's go back because, you know, you
>
> may think I'm
>
> kind of fucked up, but you know who the fucked up, most fucked up people in
>
> this city are?
>
> PhD students. Because think about it, you know? It's like 3:00 a.m. There was
>
> Lorenzo
>
> typing away on his dissertation, and he's got like a head full of statistical
>
> models
>
> and equations. How is Lorenzo going to get to sleep from there? Alt tab, oops,
>
> Pornhub.
>
> Oh, my God. And, you know, the average PhD takes eight years to complete. We're
>
> not talking
>
> good, wholesome porn here anymore. We are like way into BDSM and stepmoms and
>
> dwarves
>
> riding on ponies. And then, you know, your PhD, not Lorenzo, but another PhD,
>
> this is
>
> not about you, Lorenzo, never happened. He's happily in this five-year
>
> relationship. But
>
> your PhD, you know, he gets his PhD, and then he gets his dream job working
>
> somewhere like
>
> Google. Oh, now, now we've got them. Because, you know, and Google is like,
>
> okay, let's cram you in an office
>
> with ten other horny PhDs. Is it any surprise that last year 30,000 Google
>
> employees walked
>
> out to protest sexual harassment? They were like, we've got to get the fuck out
>
> of here.
>
> All these PhDs, they're just out of control. But I thought about this. I
>
> thought about
>
> this, and I thought there's got to be a solution to this problem. Maybe
>
> technology has the
>
> answer. And then it hit me, and this may be a bit shocking to you, but I think
>
> the answer
>
> could be sex robots. Because imagine, imagine if Google HR announces we've
>
> rolled out sex
>
> bots to all our staff, and cases of sexual harassment have dropped an amazing
>
> 83%. We
>
> use sex bot analytics to track employee performance. Since we rolled out sex
>
> bots, our staff are
>
> more focused and productive.
>
> It's clear that these are going to go mainstream. Julia, this might be why Marston
>
> just wants
>
> to be friends. Because, you know, it's not, yeah. Because just imagine, like,
>
> but then
>
> they're not just Google, but like Apple, Amazon, they're all like, holy shit,
>
> this
>
> is a billion dollar market that's going mainstream. And like Apple is like, we
>
> brought you the
>
> iPhone. We brought you the, oh wait, I did that wrong. We brought you the iPod.
>
> We brought
>
> you the iPhone. Today, we bring you the iFuck. And then Google's like, shit, we
>
> got to respond
>
> to Apple. Let's roll out the Google Ho. And then Amazon is like, oh, fuck,
>
> these guys
>
> are moving fast. Let's take Alexa. Let's take drones. We call it the flying
>
> fuck. Oh, my
>
> God, it's going to go crazy.
>
> And, you know, as with all things with technology, new technology solves some
>
> problems but brings
>
> new problems.
>
> Because, you know, you might be with your buddies and, you know, you have some
>
> beers.
>
> It gets late. And then next morning, you got to text your buddy. You're like,
>
> yo, bro,
>
> did you sleep with my sex bot last night?
>
> And he's like, oh, I'm sorry, man. I was drunk. She came on to me. And you're
>
> like,
>
> dude, you didn't even wash her out. Oh, my God. Well, there's a technology
>
> solution to
>
> that. We need sex bot security.
>
> And then you just swipe your dick to get in. And I have a patent on the R&D
>
> people.
>
> All right, guys. You guys, I think #traumatized. Thank you. You've been a lot
>
> of fun.
>
> Okay. That was Harry Fox, everybody. Oh, very nice. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> we only
>
> have one question.
