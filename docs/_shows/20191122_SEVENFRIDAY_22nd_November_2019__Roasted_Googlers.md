> The next act everybody, you're gonna love this guy. He's originally British, but he's been living
>
> here for longer than 17 years
>
> Okay, this guy's very funny. And yes, this is his real name. Everybody give it up. It's Harry Fox
>
> everybody
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, some of you think my name is Harry Fux
>
> My name is not Harry Fux. And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halver and Walther
>
> No, but the real problem with a name like Harry Fux is I get a lot of stupid comments, you know
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up to me and he's like, "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fux!
>
> Harry Fux what, man?"
>
> I was like, "What?" He's like, "Exactly, Harry Fux what, man?"
>
> So I thought, okay, he's American, I can throw him off with some adverbs
>
> Harry Fux hopefully, Harry Fux occasionally, Harry Fux enthusiastically
>
> And he was like, "No, man, no. Harry Fux goats, man. Harry Fux chickens. Harry Fux tigers."
>
> Now I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of mankind, no one has ever successfully fucked a
>
> tiger
>
> In fact, this guy made me realize that there is a whole category of unfuckable animals
>
> Like take hippos, for example
>
> Now you may get up behind a hippo and think, "Wow, that is a sweet ass."
>
> Don't do it, because hippos, they are the most dangerous land mammals, they kill about 500 people
>
> every year
>
> Do not fuck with hippos
>
> Or elephants, you know, because it's just too high up, you can't reach
>
> But if the mum isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant
>
> Alright, I'm sorry, I'm just finding your level
>
> I understand you're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality
>
> I'll try and stay away from that for you, man
>
> So, you know, I recently, let me tell you a story
>
> I recently got on Instagram and, you know, that took a long time because I always thought that
>
> Instagram was a festering cesspool of narcissists and sociopaths
>
> And then I thought, "Wait a second, these are my people! Oh my God!"
>
> But, you know, I do realize though that maybe I'm a bit too old for Instagram because some things I
>
> really have a problem with
>
> Like inspirational quotes
>
> Oh my God, when I see inspirational quotes I just fill up with rage
>
> And my brain just puts these subtitles underneath
>
> And if you guys could see those subtitles, Instagram would be a whole lot less inspirational
>
> For example, "Be yourself, there's no one better"
>
> Yeah, 7 billion people might disagree with that
>
> "If you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine"
>
> Yeah, I know, you can feel it
>
> Because they clearly cause skin cancer
>
> Or, I don't know, just like, "Living my best life"
>
> If that's your best life, maybe it needs to stop
>
> "Working smarter, not harder"
>
> Okay, you just got fired
>
> "Like a boss of a McDonald's in Dubendorf"
>
> They said I couldn't and that's why I did
>
> And that is why you're serving 15 to life
>
> "Friends are the family you get to choose"
>
> What, so if we fuck it's incest?
>
> Or, you know, like, "The way you talk to yourself matters the most"
>
> So maybe you should shut the fuck up
>
> Or, "If life hands you lemons, make lemonade"
>
> Or, "Go to Migros and buy a bag of oranges"
>
> Alright, so that's Instagram
>
> Let me switch to another app
>
> But this is an app that I love
>
> Uber
>
> I mean, Uber is amazing, you know
>
> Because Uber gets you out of the terrible pain
>
> Of having to lift your arm to your head and say those awful words
>
> "Can you send a taxi, please?"
>
> Uber gets rid of that
>
> But what's really amazing about Uber
>
> Is Uber will get you out of anything
>
> No one argues with Uber
>
> For example, you're at a house party
>
> It sucks, you know
>
> There's just fettuccine and paprika chips
>
> You know, like every Swiss house party ever
>
> And you're like, "I just want to watch Netflix"
>
> One tap, "Oh, sorry guys, my Uber's downstairs, cheers!"
>
> Gets you right out of there
>
> Or, you know, you're walking down the street
>
> You meet some friend that you haven't seen since kindergarten
>
> And they start to tell you their life story
>
> And you're like, "Oh, I can't believe this"
>
> One tap, "Sorry, my Uber's just around the corner, see you in 10 years!"
>
> Or you're in a miserable relationship
>
> You both hate each other
>
> One tap, "Okay darling, ciao, I'm out of here"
>
> You'll see you in the divorce hearings
>
> That's what Uber will do for you
>
> But, you know, I do wonder
>
> Where did Uber get its name from?
>
> Because Uber was founded by two guys called Travis and Garrett
>
> And Travis was probably like
>
> "We need a name for this app that says we're better"
>
> "Let's go with something simple like 'Above'"
>
> And Garrett was like, "Yeah, let's make it more sexy, more European"
>
> "Let's call it 'Uber'"
>
> Because those Germans know something about elitism
>
> Yeah, and so, you know, it makes me actually wonder
>
> If I could travel back in time to Berlin in 1944
>
> And speak to Adolf Hitler
>
> What I'd say to him, I'd probably be like
>
> "Yo Adolf, things aren't going to go very well for you in the next few months"
>
> "But, you would not believe what they call the 'taxi app of the future'"
>
> Okay, now I don't want to ruin Uber for you
>
> Because I know how it feels
>
> You know, when you get in that Uber, it's just like a
>
> "Oh, thank God"
>
> "Thank God I'm not on that S-Bahn to Dubendorf"
>
> "Just squashed in there with lots of other people, nowhere to sit"
>
> Yeah, it's fucked up
>
> Like, how is it that we, you know, there's corporations
>
> I won't name this particular corporation over here
>
> Corporations dominating the planet
>
> It's not okay that they do it with fascist product names
>
> I mean, imagine I was to design an app for those CrossFit fanatics, you know
>
> It's like an app for when you've got to hangover
>
> You've got to get the toxins out
>
> I come up with a name like "Sweatout"
>
> And Garrett comes up to me, he's like, "Sweatout, let's make it more sexy, more European"
>
> "Let's call this Auschwitz"
>
> Oh my God, holy shit
>
> And then you've got those dudes on Instagram just doing their workout
>
> Going, "Auschwitzing!"
>
> It's wrong, we've got to stop this
>
> Okay, but the Googlers here are very happy
>
> Because I didn't do anything about a Google product
>
> You're safe with me
>
> Let's change tack a bit
>
> Do we have any PhD students?
>
> Lorenzo, do you have a PhD?
>
> I have a PhD
>
> But you've already qualified, or you're still doing it?
>
> No, I finished out the other semester
>
> You finished long ago
>
> Oh, the ETH, that's perfect
>
> Let's go back, because you may think I'm kind of fucked up
>
> But you know who the most fucked up people in this city are?
>
> PhD students
>
> Because think about it, you know, it's like 3am
>
> There was Lorenzo typing away on his dissertation
>
> And he's got a head full of statistical models and equations
>
> How is Lorenzo going to get to sleep from there?
>
> Alt+tab, oops, Pornhub
>
> Oh my God
>
> You know, the average PhD takes 8 years to complete
>
> We're not talking good, wholesome porn here anymore
>
> We are like way into BDSM
>
> Stepmoms and dwarves riding on ponies
>
> And then, you know, your PhD, not Lorenzo, but another PhD
>
> This is not about you, Lorenzo, never happened
>
> He's happily in this 5 year relationship
>
> But your PhD, you know, he gets his PhD
>
> And then he gets his dream job
>
> Working somewhere like Google
>
> Oh, now we've got them
>
> Because, you know, and Google is like, OK
>
> Let's cram you in an office with 10 other horny PhDs
>
> Is it any surprise that last year
>
> 30,000 Google employees walked out
>
> To protest sexual harassment?
>
> They were like, we've got to get the fuck out of here
>
> All these PhDs, they're just out of control
>
> But I thought about this, I thought about this
>
> Well, there's got to be a solution to this problem
>
> Maybe technology has the answer
>
> And then it hit me, and this may be a bit shocking to you
>
> But I think the answer could be sex robots
>
> Because imagine, imagine if Google HR announces
>
> We've rolled out sex bots to all our staff
>
> And cases of sexual harassment have dropped an amazing 83%
>
> We use sex bot analytics to track employee performance
>
> Since we rolled out sex bots
>
> Our staff are more focused and productive
>
> It's clear that these are going to go mainstream
>
> Julia, this might be why Marcin just wants to be friends
>
> Because, you know, it's not, yeah
>
> Because, just imagine, like, but then
>
> They're not just Google, but like Apple, Amazon
>
> They're all like, holy shit, this is a billion dollar market
>
> That's going mainstream
>
> And like Apple is like, we brought you the iPhone
>
> We brought you the, oh wait, I did that wrong
>
> We brought you the iPod, we brought you the iPhone
>
> Today, we bring you the iFuck
>
> And then Google's like, shit, we've got to respond to Apple
>
> Let's roll out the Google Ho
>
> And then Amazon is like, oh fuck, these guys are moving fast
>
> Like Alexa, let's take drones
>
> We call it the flying fuck
>
> Oh my god, it's going to go crazy
>
> And, you know, as with all things with technology
>
> New technology solves some problems but brings new problems
>
> Because, you know, you might be with your buddies
>
> And, you know, you have some beers, it gets late
>
> And then next morning you've got to text your buddy
>
> You're like, yo bro, did you sleep with my sex bot last night?
>
> He's like, oh I'm sorry man, I was drunk
>
> She came on to me
>
> And you're like, dude, you didn't even wash her out
>
> Oh my god
>
> Well there's a technology solution to that
>
> We need sex bot security
>
> Swipe your dick to get in
>
> And I have a patent on that, R&D people
>
> Alright guys, you guys, I think #traumatized
>
> Thank you, you've been a lot of fun
