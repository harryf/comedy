> Oh, good, great. Fantastic. Okay. Let's bring up our next act. We only have two comedians left in
>
> tonight's show, everybody, so let's bring up this next guy.
>
> He is British, but he's been living here for about 17 years. He's very funny. Folks, give it up. It's
>
> Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox. And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> I don't have two kids. There's people just falling off the chairs here. Are you good? Got it under
>
> control. No, I have two kids. I had to call them "Harolder" and "Walter" just to give them a good
>
> start in life.
>
> Can you please stop laughing at my kids?
>
> Okay, but before I continue, I need to make one thing clear. I identify as an attractive woman.
>
> I'm not gay. I just identify as an attractive woman for the benefits. And I'll be at the bar after
>
> the show if you want to buy me a drink.
>
> And there are a lot of benefits to identifying as an attractive woman. Like, recently I went into
>
> Starbucks. I ordered a green tea frappuccino.
>
> And the guy said to me, "What's your name?" And I said, "My name's Harry. I'm an attractive woman."
>
> And he said, "Hey, then this drink's on the house."
>
> And I said, "Thank you. Please bring it to my table."
>
> Or another time I was driving, I was a bit over the limit, the police stopped me. They said, "We're
>
> going to need some identity."
>
> I said, "My identity is attractive woman."
>
> And they said, "Oh, well then you're free to go. After you've blown into this."
>
> Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Honestly, I didn't write these jokes. Some guy wrote them for me.
>
> But, yeah, you know, a lot of people are worrying about coronavirus, you know.
>
> I took the test, and the good news is I don't have coronavirus.
>
> The bad news? Well, I'm an attractive woman.
>
> Some of you have AIDS.
>
> I'm sorry about that. I feel bad for you.
>
> But, you know, this coronavirus thing, it did get me thinking. It's got me thinking about my
>
> mortality, you know.
>
> What's going to happen when I die, you know. That's a tough thought.
>
> And then I realized, you know, if you add up all the Hindus and the Buddhists on this planet,
>
> more than one in four people believe in reincarnation.
>
> They believe that after you die, you get reborn.
>
> I don't believe that myself, but two billion people. What if I'm wrong?
>
> And that's why I won't sleep with anyone under the age of 25.
>
> Because 25 years ago, my grandmother died.
>
> I don't want to be doing that to my grandmother. That would be terrible.
>
> I mean, she might get her first orgasm. Women didn't have orgasms back then.
>
> That would be some crazy shit.
>
> Yeah, but, you know, I got thinking.
>
> The funny thing is, can you imagine what if science proves that reincarnation is real?
>
> Wow, that would be insane. Just think of all the crazy shit that would happen.
>
> We'd have our minds blown. Then you'd get all these businesses getting into this, you know.
>
> Like Chris, the UBS guy. He'd say, "Would you like some insurance for your next life?"
>
> Or Louis, the accountant. He's got some tax returns to do.
>
> Because he's working on my 2090 tax return right now, for this joke.
>
> Or Elon Musk, he'd be like, "Hey, we guarantee if you get killed in a Tesla,
>
> we're going to bring you right back in our brand new Tesla. It's going to be fantastic."
>
> But imagine if they developed the technology, what if they could connect you with your past life?
>
> Wow, that would be insane. You go into an appointment, they say, "Mr. Fox,
>
> we've identified who you were in your last life."
>
> And you're like, "Wow, that's great." And they say, "Yeah, but there's some bad news."
>
> And you're like, "Oh, please, please, don't let it be Hitler."
>
> And they're like, "In your past life, you were Hilda, the Whore of Harlem,
>
> famous for sucking 2,000 dicks a night."
>
> You're like, "What the fuck? That's terrible!"
>
> But it does explain my strange love of currywurst.
>
> I think I'm done there. I'm just out of jokes.
