> He's a continent!
>
> He knew that already.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring up the next comedian of tonight.
>
> Ben, you'll like him. He's from the UK.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up!
>
> Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Fuck this shit.
>
> Sir, would you kindly solve your drinking problem, please?
>
> I'm about to reveal things about myself.
>
> So, you know, I'm in my mid-forties.
>
> Which means I'm more than half-dead.
>
> And when you're more than half-dead, it's really hard to give a shit about anything.
>
> Do we have any older dudes here?
>
> We have Valid. Valid, how old are you?
>
> I'm 34.
>
> 33.
>
> He's 33. Okay, I thought...
>
> I thought we had the same lesbian haircut.
>
> Maybe...
>
> So, Valid, you know, what I'm going to tell you, this is what's waiting for you.
>
> Because, you know, when you're my age, what I find is it's kind of weird.
>
> It's like, on my shoulders, I have two voices.
>
> Like, on my left shoulder, I have my younger voice.
>
> And he's very optimistic. He's, like, right about the future, trying to be a better person.
>
> But on my right shoulder, I have my older voice.
>
> And he is a motherfucker.
>
> Because, you know, everything's like, you know, I'll be just, like, drinking some water.
>
> And younger me will be like, "Hey, man, that's a plastic bottle. Think about the environment.
>
> Think about the future generations."
>
> And then older me will be like, "Ah, yeah, drink that shit.
>
> Fuck those kids and their selfie sticks."
>
> Yeah, that's what goes on.
>
> Or maybe, you know, in the morning, I wake up and younger me is like,
>
> "Hey, wake up. It's a beautiful day. Let's go and do some sports.
>
> Eat a healthy breakfast."
>
> Older me will be like, "What is that I see down there?
>
> Is that a boner?
>
> Use it before you lose it."
>
> Or, you know, maybe I'll be talking to some girl and younger me will be like,
>
> "Wow, she's really nice. Like, just, you know, have a polite, respectful conversation."
>
> But older me is like, "Feminism? Are you fucking kidding me? Check that ass!"
>
> It's brutal. It's really... I've got this internal conflict going on all the time.
>
> I don't know where it ends. Probably like Mel Gibson just running around screaming about Jews.
>
> But, you know, I'm not the only one that has it hard.
>
> Because I have a lot of lady friends and I think they really have it hard when it comes to dating.
>
> Because some of them, they say to me like, "Harry Fox, where do I find a real man?
>
> A man who knows what he wants. A man who knows how to take the lead."
>
> Now I've thought about this for a bit and I think I know the answer to this one.
>
> Because basically the problem is, ladies, it's about where you're doing that first date.
>
> Because you're probably going to like a restaurant or a bar or a cafe.
>
> And that is a very good place for him to talk about his feelings.
>
> And his ex-girlfriend. And how you remind him of his mum.
>
> No, you need to choose some places where you can get the real man out of him.
>
> So before that date, you just text him and say, "Hey, why don't you meet me in the forest?"
>
> "At the running track. Hey, you can't catch me."
>
> Or you know, or you just be like, "Yeah, hi, yeah, I'm waiting for you here in this dark alley."
>
> "You'll find me passed out drunk."
>
> Again, this could bring out the real man in him.
>
> Just go for something simple like, "Come meet me at my flat. Down in the dungeon."
>
> "And help me fight the neighbours for the washing machine."
>
> This is all things that will help bring out the real man in him.
>
> But I had this one friend of mine. She said something I thought was a little crazy.
>
> She said, "You know, what I'm really looking for is a man who knows how to put me in my place."
>
> Now that is an insane idea. Can you imagine if you go to a job interview and they say,
>
> "So what are you looking for in this job?"
>
> And you were to say, "Well, a nice working environment, a fair salary, and a boss who knows how to
>
> put me in my place."
>
> They're going to be like, "Hey, do you want this 1950s typewriter with that?"
>
> No, this is not something you should be saying to men.
>
> Because, you know, us guys, when we want to put each other in our place, we use our fists.
>
> And it has taken us 2,000 years for us to learn that's not okay with women.
>
> So I'm going to present you a radical idea.
>
> Ladies, if you think you need a guy to put you in your place,
>
> maybe, just maybe, you shouldn't be an asshole in the first place.
>
> You see that?
>
> I put you all in your place.
>
> All right, let's run.
>
> This part is fucked, but they're in their place.
>
> Here we are, Perry Farris.
>
> He put us all in a very uncomfortable space.
>
> Wow, this open mic is more racist and sexist than I thought it would be.
>
> It's worse normally.
>
> Let me bring up the next comedian, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> She's French-Canadian.
>
> She's done her open mic a couple of times before.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Vanessa Lepine.
>
> Hi, I'm sorry, before I start, I need to ask a question.
>
> Is there a doctor in the room who's single?
>
> Hey, guys, yeah, I'm French-Canadian.
>
> Usually I do comedy mostly in French, like in Lausanne and Geneva.
>
> So I'm very happy to be here tonight to do comedy in front of people that have emotions.
>
> It's really great, yeah.
>
> You guys are awesome.
>
> I would like to get to know you guys a little bit better.
>
> So if you're in your 20s, give me a "whoo!"
>
> 30s?
>
> 40s?
>
> I'm 32, and as you heard, I'm single.
>
> Oh, thanks for that, I appreciate it.
>
> I cannot see you, but thanks.
>
> And, yeah, I realize that dating in our 30s is way different than dating in my 20s.
>
> Because when I was in my 20s, I was going on dates with guys.
