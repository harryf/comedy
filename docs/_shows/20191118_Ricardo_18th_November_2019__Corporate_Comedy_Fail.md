<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Welcome to the Brown Bag Lunch Series.
>
> I have the distinct pleasure to warm up the crowd and get you all very excited.
>
> I'm sure that you're all really excited.
>
> Let me hear you say, yeah.
>
> That was awesome.
>
> I would like to introduce a long-time acquaintance, a comedian,
>
> a entrepreneur, a wanted in 13 states.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, Terry Fox.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Hooks.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelled F-E-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-E-C-K-S.
>
> I've been in a room of English speakers ever since I was 11.
>
> You'd think my name was Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Besides, in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when we call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halbert and Watford.
>
> I'm a bit disturbed by these people sat all the way by.
>
> Can you bring it down here?
>
> Because we need to include you in the awkwardness happening up front here.
>
> So, yeah, you know, the problem with this name, Harry Fox,
>
> honestly, is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And I've only really done that this much.
>
> I don't think I can answer it that much.
>
> And, you know, in fact, recently, it's been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> So, put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Okay, now, I thought I was coming to Ricardo.
>
> It turns out it's the new command that's anonymous in Chapter 2.
>
> All right, so, maybe to help you understand my condition,
>
> when you haven't had sex for a long time,
>
> it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because, you know, you could be walking down the street
>
> and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think,
>
> I wish that was me.
>
> Or, you know, you go into Mico
>
> and you spot an axion on a watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> And boom, it's like a new dimension.
>
> It's just you on that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot, it's getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to all the people.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> you're the man's shins, is it?
>
> And you look, and there's nobody about to hit you with that.
>
> You've got a handbag, and you think,
>
> she's not.
>
> Yeah, so, you know, so I've been having it hard.
>
> But, you know, I think here, in this office,
>
> we need to take a moment right now
>
> for those people working here that have it extreme,
>
> the people that have it toughest.
>
> And they're specifically, I'm talking about your managers,
>
> like Francesco, for example,
>
> and Jeremy, who's mysteriously disappeared.
>
> Oh, no, he's there.
>
> And Jeremy, because these guys have it really tough.
>
> Like, on the one hand, from a bug,
>
> they get goals like land on Mars by the end of Q4.
>
> And then on the other hand,
>
> they have to manage you.
>
> I mean, what do you want to manage you?
>
> Exactly.
>
> And one polluted person back there.
>
> And, you know, have you ever looked in their calendar?
>
> Their calendars are so packed.
>
> They have to block time.
>
> They have to go to the toilet.
>
> And can you imagine the pressure?
>
> You know, they're sat there.
>
> They're like, I've got to get three minutes to get this done.
>
> Or I've got to sit in a meeting for an hour.
>
> It's a load of pressure.
>
> But, you know, and one of the hardest things
>
> that you have to do as a manager is firing people.
>
> Now, it's so bad.
>
> But if you're a manager and you've never fired someone
>
> before, it's behind your back if you're a virgin.
>
> Because, you know, you might be hanging out
>
> by the coffee machine with some other managers
>
> and they're like, yeah, I've got to fire that guy.
>
> And you go, yeah, I fire people too.
>
> And they're going to be like, who is this virgin?
>
> And, you know, and then the big day comes.
>
> You know, it's your first time you're going to fire someone.
>
> And before you do, you're all nervous and tense.
>
> And then it comes and then you just fire them far too quickly.
>
> And afterwards, you're like, you say something stupid like,
>
> how was it for you?
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> And then you're like, I don't know.
>
> This is why, you know, this is the pressure
>
> these guys are under.
>
> And I understand the pressure myself.
>
> Because I'm a single dad, you know, I have a job.
>
> I have two teenage kids who live with me.
>
> And, you know, it's a lot to deal with, you know.
>
> And it's even made harder these days by technology.
>
> For example, my son, he plays Fortnite.
>
> And for those of you that don't know, sorry,
>
> I'm just smiling a bit because Jeremy's giving me this.
>
> And I was like, oh, what is this?
>
> What is coming now?
>
> But I'm going to get back into the zone, you know.
>
> He plays Fortnite.
>
> So for those of you that don't know,
>
> Fortnite is a shooter you play online against other people.
>
> And recently, the makers of Fortnite
>
> said they had 125 million players online all at once.
>
> This is so many kids.
>
> People are saying they are ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me as a father, I think Fortnite
>
> might actually be teaching my son some important live skills.
>
> For example, he's learned to sit in a chair for eight hours
>
> without moving, speaking, or going to the toilet, which
>
> is obviously great preparation for office life.
>
> And his English has radically improved thanks to Fortnite.
>
> He's learned some key phrases like, bitch, I will fuck you up,
>
> or I will piss on you like Donald Trump, you know.
>
> So it makes me very proud, you know, responsible player.
>
> But, you know, that's my son.
>
> I also have a teenage daughter.
>
> Now, as a single father of a teenage daughter,
>
> I am constantly being confronted with situations
>
> that I am fully unprepared for.
>
> Like recently, I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom, and oh, my god,
>
> it looked like it was wine and cereal.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror,
>
> drops of blood on the sink, more blood on the floor.
>
> And the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming.
>
> And I looked around.
>
> And I realized a screaming was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter sat up and said, hey, dad,
>
> I got my period.
>
> So that's a killing of her nature.
>
> But I was like, can I get you anything?
>
> And she was like, dad, get me 10 points.
>
> Now, obviously, as a man, I--
>
> you know, I have zero qualifications for this stuff.
>
> But I thought, this can't be so hard.
>
> So I went back to New York, where I live.
>
> And I took a look around.
>
> And what I discovered is that 10-point product names
>
> are, in fact, of no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to using a napalm.
>
> For example, you have names like bogey to blow.
>
> I think that's, like, a professional name
>
> that means something to me.
>
> It didn't sound like something I loved in my day to day life.
>
> And 10-patch radios.
>
> You know what they say.
>
> They're, like, glow-in-the-dark 10 points.
>
> So when the lights are out, you need to get it in.
>
> The one I like the most is Always in Tennessee.
>
> I thought it was a great legend.
>
> So it's Always in Tennessee.
>
> The one in the vagina isn't unsuitable by color.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product by yours.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> Isn't it amazing?
>
> It's around about 10 o'clock.
>
> It starts early.
>
> It's Always Home by Eleven.
>
> And the whole experience for me as a father
>
> was a very terrible one.
>
> Because it's a product that's not every day
>
> that you get to choose what you're going to find
>
> and what you're buying.
>
> And I think that is the right way for me
>
> to stop the comedy while you stop
>
> while you're eating something.
>
> So we're done with the comedy part now.
>
> If you want to applause, you can.
>
> If you need to leave, please do.
>
> Thank you.
