> to the brown bag lunch series.
>
> I have the distinct pleasure to warm up the crowd
>
> and get you all very excited.
>
> I'm sure that you're all really excited.
>
> Let me hear you say, yeah.
>
> That was awesome.
>
> I would like to introduce a long-time acquaintance,
>
> a comedian, an entrepreneur, a wanted in 13 states,
>
> ladies and gentlemen, Harry Fox.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room of English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Besides, in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halbert and Watson.
>
> I'm a bit disturbed by these people sat all the way back
>
> there.
>
> Can we bring you down here?
>
> Because we need to include you in the awkwardness
>
> happening up front here.
>
> So yeah, you know, the problem with this name, Harry Fox,
>
> honestly, is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And I've only really done about this much acting.
>
> I haven't done too much acting.
>
> And in fact, recently, it's been a long time
>
> since I've had sex at school.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> OK, now, I thought I was coming to Ricardo.
>
> It turns out it's an infomaniac synonymous with up at two.
>
> All right, so maybe to help you understand my condition,
>
> when you haven't had sex for a long time,
>
> it's kind of like the hallucination.
>
> Because, you know, you could be walking down the street,
>
> and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them, and you think, it's too shallow to me.
>
> Or, you know, you go into Migo, and you spot an axion
>
> on a watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> And boom, it's like a new dimension.
>
> It's just you on that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to all the people
>
> and then you hear this, you're the man's chance, is it?
>
> And you look, and there's an old lady about to hit you
>
> with a handbag.
>
> And you think, she's hot.
>
> Yeah, so, you know, it's not that I'm having it hard.
>
> But, you know, I think here in this office,
>
> we need to take a moment right now for those people working
>
> here that had an extreme event.
>
> The people that had the toughest.
>
> And there, specifically, I'm talking about your managers.
>
> Like, Francesco, for example, and Jeremy,
>
> who's mysteriously disappeared at this point.
>
> Oh, no, he's there.
>
> And Jeremy, because these guys have it really tough.
>
> Like, on the one hand, from above,
>
> they get goals like land on Mars by end of Q4.
>
> And then on the other hand, they have to manage you.
>
> I mean, would you want to manage you?
>
> Exactly.
>
> And one deluded person back there.
>
> And, you know, had never looked in their calendars.
>
> Their calendars are so packed.
>
> They have to book time to go to the toilet.
>
> And can you imagine the pressure?
>
> You know, they're sat there going,
>
> I've got to get three minutes to get this done,
>
> or I've got to sit in a meeting for an hour.
>
> It's a lot of pressure.
>
> But, you know, one of the hardest things
>
> you have to do as a manager is firing people.
>
> Now, it's so bad that if you're a manager
>
> and you've never fired someone before,
>
> it's kind of like you're a virgin.
>
> Because, you know, you might be hanging out
>
> by the coffee machine with some other managers,
>
> and they're like, yeah, I have to fire that guy.
>
> And you go, yeah, I fire people too.
>
> And they look at you like, who is this virgin?
>
> And, you know, and then the big day comes.
>
> You know, it's the first time you're going to fire someone.
>
> Before the big, you're all nervous and tense.
>
> And then it comes, and then you just fire them far too quickly.
>
> And afterwards, you're like, you say something stupid,
>
> like, how was it for you?
>
> This is why, you know, this is the pressure
>
> these guys are under.
>
> And I understand the pressure myself.
>
> Because I'm a single dad, you know, I have a job.
>
> I have two teenage kids that live with me.
>
> And, you know, it's a lot to deal with, you know.
>
> And it's even made harder these days by technology.
>
> For example, my son, he plays "Fortnite."
>
> And for those of you that don't know, sorry,
>
> I'm just smiling a bit because Jeremy is giving me
>
> this look like, oh, what is coming now?
>
> But, well, I'm going to get back into the zone, you know.
>
> He plays "Fortnite."
>
> So for those of you that don't know,
>
> "Fortnite" is a shooter you play online against other people.
>
> And recently, the makers of "Fortnite"
>
> said they had 125 million players online all at once.
>
> This is so many kids.
>
> People are saying they are ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me, as a father, I think "Fortnite"
>
> might actually be teaching my son some important life skills.
>
> For example, he's learned to sit in a chair for eight hours
>
> without moving, speaking, or going to the toilet,
>
> which is obviously a great preparation for office life.
>
> And his English has radically improved thanks to "Fortnite."
>
> He's learned some key phrases like, "Bitch,
>
> I will fuck you up," or "I will piss on you like Donald Trump."
>
> It makes me very proud, you know, responsible parenting.
>
> But, you know, that's my son.
>
> I also have a teenage daughter.
>
> Now, as a single father with a teenage daughter,
>
> I am constantly being confronted with situations
>
> that I am totally unprepared for.
>
> Like, recently, I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom, and, oh, my God,
>
> it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror,
>
> drops of blood on the sink, more blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around,
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter sat up and said,
>
> "Hey, Dad, I got my period."
>
> So to clean up her menstrual blood, I was like,
>
> "Can I get you anything?"
>
> And she was like, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, obviously, as a man,
>
> I have zero qualifications for this job,
>
> but I thought, "This can't be so hard."
>
> So I went back to me going, "Where are we?"
>
> And I took a look around,
>
> and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly of no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> For example, you have names like "Phoebe Probe."
>
> What is this, like, the professional women
>
> that do these kind of things?
>
> Doesn't sound like something I want with my daughter.
>
> Or "Tampax Radiance."
>
> What are they saying, like, glow-in-the-dark tampons,
>
> so when the lights are out, you need to get it in?
>
> The one I like the most is "Always Infinity."
>
> I thought it was very imaginative, "Always Infinity."
>
> The one in the vagina isn't an infeasible black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product by Laws.
>
> It's called "Always Home by 11."
>
> It is amazing.
>
> It's around about 10 o'clock, it starts to leak,
>
> and she is "Always Home by 11."
>
> And the whole experience for me as a father,
>
> it was a very proud one, because as a father,
>
> it's not every day that you get to choose
>
> what your daughter's tampon has in her vagina.
>
> And I think that is the right place for me
>
> to stop the comedy while you stop the audience on something.
>
> So we're going with the comedy part now.
>
> If you want to applause, you can.
>
> If you need to, leave, please do.
