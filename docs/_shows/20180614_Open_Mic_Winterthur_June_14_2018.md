<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> What's going on? This comedian has waited the whole night to get up on stage,
>
> and here he is everybody, very funny, Harry Fuchs everybody, put your hands
>
> together for him.
>
> So actually it's Harry Fuchs, that's spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat F-U-C-K-S.
>
> So now all the English speakers in the room really do think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs, actually that's because Harry Fuchs is a very hard
>
> name to move up to, it's a very high level expectation.
>
> If I was Harry Fuchs, I wouldn't have come on stage and just said I am Harry, I'd
>
> be like, you're Harry Fuchs in the house man, what are you doing?
>
> But that's not really my personality.
>
> And when it comes to dating, I'm a little bit choosy.
>
> And I'm not going to just sleep with anything, but Harry Fuchs is going to be
>
> like, yo man, if there's a hole I'm good, and you know, that's kind of gross.
>
> But the real reason is actually more that I'm just not getting it, it's been
>
> quite a long time.
>
> Actually, put your hand up if you haven't had sex in a very long time.
>
> I'll put that one.
>
> That's the one guy.
>
> Otherwise, I didn't realize I was coming to the winter tour and implementing X
>
> and Y.
>
> So you probably don't really understand where I'm coming from, maybe I can
>
> explain a little bit.
>
> Because when you haven't had sex in a long time, everything slowly and subtly
>
> starts to look different.
>
> It's like kind of hallucinations.
>
> For example, you could be walking on the street, you see a couple of dogs, and
>
> you know, they're sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them, and you think, I wish that was me.
>
> Or, you know, you're in Negro, and you're in the fruit section, and you see an
>
> axiom on watermelon.
>
> You put one hand on that watermelon, and you put two hands.
>
> And suddenly it's like you're in another dimension.
>
> And you start to go, and you're completely oblivious to the fact that there's
>
> people around you.
>
> You're just there, and your heart's starting to race, and you're like, wow.
>
> And then suddenly you hear this,
>
> You're my man, what's on your mind?
>
> And there's this old lady standing there, and she's about to hit you with a
>
> handbag.
>
> And you think, wow, she's there.
>
> That's what it's like.
>
> It's a bit of a desperate thing.
>
> I'm actually from England, and I read recently that the British government
>
> commissioned a survey of dick pics.
>
> So we have pictures of your dick.
>
> This is true.
>
> You can look it up.
>
> What they found, one of the things they found was that men between the ages of
>
> 18 and 36,
>
> have sent, usually about 50 percent, have sent a dick pic within the last 12
>
> months.
>
> Now, that may be a difficult number to visualize, but for you ladies,
>
> that would be like, if you give your number to ten guys in this room,
>
> within a few weeks you'll have five dicks on your butt.
>
> I don't send dick pics myself.
>
> No.
>
> That's not because I'm better, it's because actually I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because taking a quality dick pic is hard.
>
> You've got a lot to think about, you've got the lighting, do you go for some
>
> soft lighting to bring out the skin color?
>
> Or do you go for something more kind of red and erotic?
>
> Or maybe you also need to think about props, like maybe I should spread some
>
> tulips around here just to have my dick poking through.
>
> Something a bit more romantic.
>
> But the real tough one is getting the right angle.
>
> Is it the best angle?
>
> Or is it the best angle?
>
> Or is it the best angle?
>
> And that's actually why I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> You can get it on dickpicselfiestick.com.
>
> It's for 29.99 tonight only for everyone.
>
> Yeah, but it's funny, like actually one of my earliest childhood memories was
>
> about my penis.
>
> It was actually when I got circumcised.
>
> Now, I hope that you can see it.
>
> I hope everyone knows what circumcision is.
>
> Just to check, anyone who doesn't, please talk to me after.
>
> And I wasn't circumcised for religious reasons.
>
> I was actually circumcised because there was a medical emergency.
>
> And the only way they could save my life was by cutting my foreskin off.
>
> So what was, but actually what was a kind of traumatic childhood experience
>
> actually became something as an advantage in adult life.
>
> Because what I found was that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> And I found that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> And I found that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> And I found that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> And I found that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> And I found that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> And I found that it was a kind of traumatic childhood experience.
>
> Because what I found is on those rare occasions where a woman does get near the
>
> end of my penis, I usually breathe a big sigh of relief. And I'm like, hey, why
>
> are you sighing on my penis? And they say, because it's just a huge relief. It's
>
> like, do you know how many dirty dicks there are out there? And I'm like, what's
>
> this?
>
> And what I learned is that amongst my uncut brethren, those who haven't been
>
> circumcised, that many are not putting enough attention in this area.
>
> So what I thought is I'd just finish on giving you a few tips about what you
>
> could do.
>
> One thing you can do is air freshener.
>
> You know, like in a car, that thing you hang from the rear view mirror, like a
>
> wunderbaum, just hang it up on your dick.
>
> Women are very sensitive to smell.
>
> That will help them get over that.
>
> Women are also very visual.
>
> So what you can do is try tattooing a nice scene above your penis.
>
> Maybe a green field with some flowers growing in it.
>
> A tree with some birds singing in it.
>
> You know, something that will take the mind off the disgusting act that they
>
> have.
>
> But I think probably the easiest and most effective thing you can do is just
>
> bring a box of crackers with you.
>
> And you can kind of...
>
> While she's down there, feed her crackers.
>
> Because, you know, cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> Alright, thank you.
>
> I'm done.
>
> Thank you.
