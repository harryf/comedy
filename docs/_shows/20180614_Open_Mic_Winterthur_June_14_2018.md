<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> So this comedian has waited the whole night to get up on stage, and here he is everybody.
>
> Very funny, Harry Fox everybody, put your hands together for him.
>
> So actually it's Harry Fox, that's spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> So now all the English speakers in the room really do think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox, actually, that's because Harry Fox is a very hard name to live
>
> up to, it's a very high level expectation.
>
> If I was Harry Fox, I wouldn't have come on stage and just said "Hi, I'm Harry."
>
> I'd be like, "Yo, Harry Fox in the house, man, what are you doing?"
>
> But that's not really my personality, and you know, when it comes to dating, I'm a little
>
> bit choosy, and I'm not going to just sleep with anything.
>
> But Harry Fox is going to be like, "Yo man, if there's a hole, I'm good."
>
> And you know, that's kind of gross.
>
> But the real reason is actually more that I'm just not getting any.
>
> It's been quite a long time.
>
> Actually, put your hand up if you haven't had sex in a very long time.
>
> Otherwise, I didn't realise I was coming to the Winter Tour of Infamy at some point.
>
> So you probably don't really understand where I'm coming from, maybe I can explain a little
>
> bit.
>
> Because when you haven't had sex in a long time, everything slowly and subtly starts
>
> to look different.
>
> It's like having hallucinations.
>
> For example, you could be walking on the street, you see a couple of dogs, and you know, they're
>
> sniffing each other's asses, and you look at them, and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you're in Migros, and you're in the fruit section, and you see an action on a watermelon.
>
> You put one hand on that watermelon, or you put two hands.
>
> And suddenly it's like you're in another dimension.
>
> And it starts to go, and you're completely oblivious to the fact that there's people
>
> around you, you're just there, and your heart's starting to race, and you're like, "Wow."
>
> And then suddenly you hear this, "Junge Mann, wasse eine Feigheit!"
>
> And there's this old lady standing there, and she's about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, "Wow, she's hot."
>
> Those were the times, those were the times.
>
> I'm actually from England, and I read recently that the British government commissioned a
>
> survey of dick pics.
>
> So pictures of your dick, this is true, you can look it up.
>
> What they found, one of the things they found was that men between the ages of 18 and 36
>
> have sent, usually about 50% have sent a dick pic within the last 12 months.
>
> Now, that may be a difficult number to visualize, but for you ladies, that would be like, if
>
> you give your number to 10 guys in this room, within a few weeks you'll have five dicks
>
> on your phone.
>
> So that's, I don't send dick pics myself, that's not because I'm bad at it, it's because
>
> actually I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because taking a quality dick pic is hard, it's really hard.
>
> You've got a lot to think about, you've got the lighting, do you go for some soft lighting
>
> to bring out the skin color, or do you go for something more kind of red and erotic?
>
> Or maybe you also need to think about props, you know, like maybe I should spray some tulips
>
> around here, just to have my dick poking through, so you can get a bit more romantic.
>
> But, you know, I mean, the real tough one is getting the right angle, it's like, is
>
> it the best angle here, or up here, or like this?
>
> And that's actually why I'm a bit of an entrepreneur, I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> You can get it on dickpicselfiestick.com, it's probably $29.99 tonight only for everyone
>
> who can afford it.
>
> Yeah, but it's funny, like actually one of my earliest childhood memories was about my
>
> penis.
>
> It was actually when I got circumcised.
>
> Now, I hope everyone knows what circumcision is, just check, anyone who doesn't, please
>
> talk to me after.
>
> And I wasn't circumcised for religious reasons, I was actually circumcised because there was
>
> a medical emergency, and the only way they could save my life was by cutting my foreskin
>
> off.
>
> So what was, but actually what was a kind of traumatic childhood experience actually
>
> became something as an advantage in adult life, because what I found is on those rare
>
> occasions where a woman does get near the end of my penis, I usually breathe a big sigh
>
> of relief, and I'm like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And they say, "Because, it's just a huge relief, it's like, do you know how many dirty dicks
>
> there are out there?"
>
> And I'm like, "What's this?"
>
> And what I learned is that amongst my uncut brethren, those who haven't been circumcised,
>
> that many are not putting enough attention in this area.
>
> So what I thought is I'd just finish on giving you a few tips about what you could do.
>
> One thing you can do is air freshener, you know, like in a car.
>
> You hang it from the rear view mirror, like a Wonderbaum, just hang it up on your dick.
>
> Women are very sensitive to smell, that will help them get over that.
>
> Women are also very visual, so what you can do is try tattooing a nice scene above your
>
> penis.
>
> Maybe a green field with some flowers growing in it, or a tree with some dirt singing in
>
> it.
>
> Something that will take their mind off the disgusting act that they have to do.
>
> I think probably the easiest and most effective thing you can do is just bring a box of crackers
>
> with you, and you can kind of, while she's down there, feed her crackers.
>
> Because, you know, cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> Thank you, I'm done.
