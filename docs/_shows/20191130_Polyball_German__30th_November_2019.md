notes: |
  One of 7 or 8 sets in a long night of comedy. This one in German. Was 50/50 German / English. What I remember about this was it was a night of become a “comedy robot”. After doing 8 shows in one night I no longer really cared if people liked me or not. Which led to funnier moments and shows I did in the weeks after this one I was more relaxed. So kind of a break through moment in comedy…

> Kingdom.
>
> So I just wanted to say: Welcome Harry Fuchs!
>
> That's what I said. Big applause for Harry Fuchs!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name.
>
> You write F-U-C-K-S. I repeat: F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But because I grew up in England, I call myself a lot Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we meet, we get very close.
>
> My mom calls us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two children. I had to call them Halber and Wadber.
>
> But that takes some time to understand.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is that it sets very high
>
> expectations.
>
> And to be honest, I've only had so much sex...
>
> And lately, in the last few months, I haven't had any sex.
>
> Hands up if you haven't had any sex for a long time.
>
> Okay, that surprises me.
>
> Wow, I thought that was after the Poly Bowl.
>
> Okay, but I understand. We're here at the Zurich Infomercial, an anonymous
>
> event.
>
> I try to tell you a little bit about how it is for me, how it is with my
>
> condition.
>
> It's almost as if you're being polluted.
>
> So when I walk down the street and I see a couple of dogs, and they're licking
>
> their asses.
>
> And I think: I want to be part of it too.
>
> Or you go to Migros and you see an action on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on the watermelon, maybe two.
>
> And boom!
>
> You're suddenly in a new dimension.
>
> I'm in this watermelon.
>
> No matter who's watching.
>
> And then I hear: "Boy, shame on you!"
>
> And I look, there's an old woman and she doesn't want to hit me with her handbag.
>
> And I think: "Very nice!"
>
> Yes, it's difficult.
>
> What also bothers me quite a bit at the moment is:
>
> Even at my age, I don't know if I'm good at sex.
>
> Because in the end I read something that says:
>
> "To be good at something, it takes 10,000 hours."
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of work.
>
> So if you get 24 hours a day for one year,
>
> then you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> That's calculated.
>
> Or if you get up to 70,
>
> you have to fuck 10 times a day.
>
> From the day you were born
>
> to the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's so strange about it.
>
> The thought of "Why do I fuck them?"
>
> or the idea of sex with old people
>
> on the day they die.
>
> That was a little too dark.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I think at the moment it's a very difficult time.
>
> Especially for women.
>
> Because I saw a statistic that says:
>
> Almost 50% of men between 20 and 40
>
> have had a dick pic in the last three months.
>
> That's a huge number.
>
> To visualize this:
>
> If you divide the number by 10 men here,
>
> before Christmas
>
> you have a stack of punk dicks on your phone.
>
> And then you can use it for Christmas cards,
>
> to decorate your Christmas tree.
>
> You can do a lot with it.
>
> Personally, I personally don't send dick pics.
>
> Not because I'm better,
>
> but because I'm a perfectionist.
>
> Sending such a good dick pic is difficult,
>
> because you have to think about a lot.
>
> For example, the light.
>
> Do I need a nice color that brings out the main color?
>
> Or something more red and erotic?
>
> Do I need a few objects, like roses?
>
> And so on and so forth.
>
> It's a little dangerous.
>
> With the thorns.
>
> You have to think about which one looks better.
>
> Are they selfies?
>
> Here?
>
> Or here?
>
> It's difficult.
>
> But I'm a little entrepreneurial.
>
> That's why I developed the Dick Pic Selfie Stick.
>
> For all of you here,
>
> you can get it at DickPicSelfieStick.com.
>
> Only 29.99 tonight.
>
> Okay.
>
> This is my gift for you.
>
> A Polyball.
>
> Thank you very much.
>
> Have a nice evening.
>
> Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> Harry Fox.
>
> Sorry.
>
> So.
>
> We're at the last act.
>
> And it's actually also an English comedy.
>
> So.
>
> Please.
>
> Welcome to the stage.
>
> Shane Orton.
>

>
> What is it?
>
> Okay.
>

>

>
> It's funny to be a hopper.
>
> I broke my ankle last year.
>
> Just after biking.
>
> I spent a lot of time on crutches.
>
> Here in Switzerland and England.
>
> Our reaction to people could not be different.
>
> In England, everyone is talking to me.
>
> "Oh, you did well!"
>
> "Oh, you did well!"
>
> "Oh, I hope you will be there soon!"
>
> In Switzerland, first of all, no one wanted to talk to me.
>
> But in general, they always had the same answer.
>
> "Same thing!"
>
> Hello everyone from Switzerland.
>
> I'm from England, a region called Essex.
>
> Do you know Essex?
>
> For those who don't know, Essex is shit.
>
> We are outside the big city.
>
> No one likes us.
>
> No one wants to visit us.
>
> We have a very bad reputation.
>
> In Switzerland, there is only one region that is equal.
>
> That is the Canterbury Gau.
>
> Does anyone here have a Canterbury Gau?
>
> That's beautiful.
>
> It's beautiful.
>
> This is something that is very special to us.
>
> These are our Essex girls.
>
> They are worldwide famous.
>
> Worldwide famous.
>
> With their orange, self-brown, black hair.
>
> But we have to admit it, right?
>
> Because they made this song very hot.
>
> Long before we all heard about it.
>
> Do you know the "Essig Mädels"?
>
> Do you know what it means?
>
> I'll tell you.
>
> Teenage pregnancy.
>
> Yes, unfortunately I can't laugh.
>
> But my mother was 16 when I came to the world.
>
> But it wasn't that bad for me to have a young mother.
>
> For example, I always had a son-in-law.
>
> And the part of the other children, they were always very friendly.
>
> But there were things that were difficult.
>
> For example, it was funny.
>
> For example, it was funny that both of them could go to school.
>
> And both at the same price.
>
> But for some, it wasn't that easy.
>
> Or it's more difficult to have a child.
>
> A child.
>
> So when you have a child at the age of 16, it's a bit like a stumbling block in
>
> the Catholic children's choir.
>
> The church destroys it.
>
> I know what you're thinking.
>
> "Same fault."
>
> Exactly.
>

>
> I want to live in one of the countries in the world where I can save money.
>
> Where you can only go on vacation.
>
> And you don't just save money, but you also feel comfortable.
>
> And you come around and say, "Hmm, this is shit here."
>
> The other big advantage, I have to say, right?
>
> The other big advantage is the loyalty in Switzerland.
