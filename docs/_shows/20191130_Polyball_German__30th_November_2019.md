  One of 7 or 8 sets in a long night of comedy. This one in German. Was 50/50 German / English. What I remember about this was it was a night of become a “comedy robot”. After doing 8 shows in one night I no longer really cared if people liked me or not. Which led to funnier moments and shows I did in the weeks after this one I was more relaxed. So kind of a break through moment in comedy…

> Two more ads and the next ad comes originally from Great Britain and I just wanted to say
>
> Welcome Harry Fuchs!
>
> Let me say a big round of applause for Harry Fuchs!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs, that's a German name, you write F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S
>
> But because I grew up in England, many call me Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family, when we meet, we get very annoyed when you call us a group of f*ckers.
>
> And I have two children, I had to call them Halver and Walther.
>
> But that takes a bit of time to process.
>
> But the real problem with names like Harry Fuchs is that it sets very high expectations.
>
> To be honest, I've never had so much sex, okay, to be honest, it was so much sex.
>
> And in the last time, in the last months, I've actually, if I may say so, had no sex.
>
> Hands up if you haven't had sex for a long time.
>
> Okay, that surprises me.
>
> Wow, I thought it was after the polyball.
>
> Okay, but I understand, we're here at the Zurich Nymphomania Anonymity.
>
> Okay, I'll try to tell you a little bit about how it is for me, how it is with my condition.
>
> It's almost as if you hallucinate.
>
> So when I walk down the street and I see a couple of dogs, and they're sniffing at each other.
>
> And I think, "I want to be part of it too."
>
> Or you go to the micro, and you see an action on watermelons.
>
> You get one hand on the watermelon, maybe two.
>
> And then you're suddenly in a new dimension.
>
> And you're sniffing this watermelon, no matter who's watching.
>
> And then I hear, "Boy, why are you ashamed?"
>
> And I look, there's a group of women, they want to hit me with their handbags.
>
> And I think, "Very nice."
>
> Yeah, it's difficult.
>
> What also bothers me a lot at the moment is, even at my age, I don't know if I'm good at sex.
>
> Because recently I read something that said, "To be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours."
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of f*cking.
>
> So if you f*ck 24 hours a day, in one year, you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> That's calculated.
>
> And if you live to 70, you have to f*ck 10 times a day, from the day you were born until the day
>
> you die.
>
> And I don't know what's wrong with the idea of f*cking babies.
>
> Or the idea of having sex with old people on the day they die.
>
> Okay, that was a bit too dark, I'm sorry.
>
> So, I think at the moment it's a very difficult time, especially for women.
>
> Because I saw a statistic that said, almost 50% of men between the ages of 20 and 40 have had a
>
> dick-dick in the last three months.
>
> That's a huge number.
>
> And to visualize that, if you divide the number by 10 men here, before Christmas you have a stack
>
> of 5 dicks on your phone.
>
> And then you could use it for Christmas cards, to decorate a Christmas tree, you can do a lot with
>
> it.
>
> So I personally don't send dick-dicks.
>
> Not because I'm better, but because I'm a perfectionist.
>
> Because to send such a good dick-dick is difficult, because you have to think about a lot of things.
>
> For example, the light. Do I need a beautiful color that brings out the main color, or something
>
> more red and erotic?
>
> Do I need a few objects, like roses?
>
> All around here, it's a bit dangerous, with the thorns.
>
> So you have to think about which angle is best, like a selfie, like here, or here, or...
>
> It's difficult, but I'm a bit of an entrepreneur, that's why I developed the dick-dick selfie stick.
>
> You can all get it on dick-dick-selfie-stick.com, tonight at 9.29 pm.
>
> Okay, that's my gift for you at the Polyball. Thank you very much, have a nice evening.
>
> So, we're at the last act, and it's actually also an English comedy.
>
> So, please, welcome to the stage, to Shane Orto!
>
> Shane Orto, a big round of applause! I don't know you, so I don't need a big round of applause.
>
> What's your name? Okay.
>
> Nice to meet you!
>
> So, today I'm going to try to do something that the Swiss themselves can't do.
>
> To be funny while sitting.
>
> So, I broke my ankle, while biking, and I spent time on crutches, here in Switzerland, also in
>
> England.
>
> And the reaction of the people couldn't be any different. In one corner, everyone wanted to talk to
>
> me.
>
> "Oh, James, did you do well? Oh, did it hurt? Oh, I hope you didn't die again."
>
> In Switzerland, at first, no one wanted to talk to me, because they always had the same answer.
>
> "Same school."
>
> Do you know Switzerland? Yes, that's how it is in England, a region called Essex.
>
> Do you know Essex?
>
> Shit.
>
> For those of you who don't know, Essex is shit.
>
> We're sitting outside a big city.
>
> No one likes us, no one wants to visit us. We have a terrible reputation.
>
> In Switzerland, there's only one region that's the same.
>
> That's the Canton of Aargau.
>
> Does anyone here live in the Canton of Aargau?
>
> Beautiful, isn't it?
>
> We have something that's very special.
>
> These are our Essex girls.
>
> They have red, white and red hair, like their orange self-dyed eyebrows.
>
> But I don't have to give it to you, right?
>
> Because they made this city hateful, years before we all got used to it.
>
> Do you know the Essex girls?
>
> I'll tell you. Teenage puberty.
>
> Yes, unfortunately I'm not allowed to laugh.
>
> But my mother was sexy when I was born.
>
> But it wasn't so bad for me to have young dogs.
>
> For example, I always had a pig.
>
> And the parents of the other children were always very friendly.
>
> But there were also things that were strange.
>
> For example, it was strange that they could both get on the bus.
>
> And both were half price.
>
> But for a dog it wasn't all that easy.
>
> It's difficult to have a child.
>
> When you have a child at six years old, it's a bit like a spiral.
>
> It destroys the childhood.
>
> I know what you're thinking.
>
> The same school.
>
> But that's not true.
>
> Now I live in Switzerland.
>
> I've been living in Switzerland for ten years.
>
> And I have to say, the biggest advantage of Switzerland is the quality of life.
>
> I live in one of the few countries in the world where you can save money when you only go on
>
> holiday.
>
> And you don't just save money, you also feel good.
>
> And you look around and think, "Hmm, they shit here."
>
> The other big advantage is the loyalty to Switzerland.
>
> If you make a Swiss friend, you make a Swiss friend of life.
>
> That's what I heard.
>
> Do you spend your life with Swiss friends?
>
> No?
>
> Shit, do more!
>
> Do more!
>
> What else can I say?
>
> The other big advantage is safety.
>
> In the summer we can go swimming and leave our stuff on the beach.
>
> And when the sun comes up, they're still there.
>
> What I like to do is to test the limits of safety.
>
> And I leave a lot of things unattended and see if they're still there when I come back.
>
> My wife hates me for doing that with our daughter.
>
> Just a joke, we don't have any daughters.
>
> Not anymore.
>
> Merci beacause you shake gold!
