<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> My next performer is going to be Harry Fox, and I have to say, I am very much disappointed
>
> that a guy looking like him, with a name like him, is not a wasted 80s porn star with a
>
> mustache.
>
> However, I am very grateful having met Harry, because whenever I'm wondering what it is
>
> with middle-aged white guys turning their weirdness into creepiness, I just give Harry
>
> a call and ask him, and whenever I cannot reach him, I'm just going to phone Marcus.
>
> Same spectrum, same spectrum.
>
> I mean, Harry tries desperately with his comedy to be as sexy as a sweet potato, but I told
>
> him recently, "Harry, the only thing you and a sweet potato have in common is that at some
>
> point they're getting fried.
>
> The sweet potato is getting more delicious, and your skin is so fried by the sun you look
>
> like Donatella Versace."
>
> And I mean Donatella now, not the coked-up, swollen-up 80s version of Donatella, where
>
> you were like, "Yeah, I'd do that, you know, after a couple of drinks.
>
> She's rich.
>
> I'd maybe meet her brother, because I'm secretly gay, and I want to meet Johnny."
>
> But no, Harry's just trying.
>
> Harry Fox, his face and his name have disappointed more women than Tiger Woods.
>
> They've disappointed more women than Sex and the City 2.
>
> They've disappointed more women than Harvey Weinstein.
>
> Too much?
>
> Have you heard the rest of the show that was soft?
>
> I'm not being mean and nasty.
>
> He can take it.
>
> He's a power bottom.
>
> I mean, really.
>
> He can take it.
>
> I mean, give him a good look and tell me you wouldn't be worried if you were driving by
>
> your child's school, slowly, in that lightly lemon-colored van, trying to sell your children
>
> candy.
>
> No, he wouldn't do that.
>
> He has two children of his own.
>
> Sadly, he didn't bring 'em.
>
> I wanted him to bring his son, just to show his son, "You have no chance, Gromia.
>
> You're not normal with a father named Harry Fox."
>
> So, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for a guy who will always be overshadowed by his
>
> own name.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> I mean, am I right if you look at the penis and the appearance of a sex offender?
>
> Yes, I am.
>
> Even if you wouldn't dare to say it because you're standing here, I dare, I say the truth.
>
> Therefore, I'm dangerous with a microphone.
>
> Give a huge round of applause for Harry again!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S, but when I'm in a room with English
>
> speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox, and in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get
>
> very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> "Oh, I thought it was going to be a fuck-fest."
>
> I'm sure you did.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I've had to call them "Halberd" and "Walder," just so I can get started.
>
> The real problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of expectation,
>
> and there just hasn't been enough fucking...
>
> If I can share this with you, it has actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Obviously.
>
> He's going to write a book called "The Joy of No Sex," but no, I hadn't realized I was
>
> coming to the Basel Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meeting, so maybe if I can just explain my
>
> condition a bit, how it is when you haven't had sex in a long time, because it's kind
>
> of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be walking down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's
>
> asses, you look at them and think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, you spot an acción on a watermelon, you get one hand on that
>
> watermelon, maybe two, BAM, it's like you're in a new dimension, it's just you and that
>
> watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot, it's getting steamy, you don't care about all the people watching,
>
> and then you hear this voice saying, "You're the man's shaman," and you look and there's
>
> an old lady about to hit you with her handbag, and you think, "She's nice."
>
> Do you know what makes this even more depressing, is that even at my age, I don't really know
>
> if I'm any good at sex, because I read recently, to be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking hours.
>
> I mean, if I add it all up, maybe, maybe I get to 5,000 hours, if I include masturbation.
>
> But I did some maths on this, and I'm like, "I've got to figure this out," because what
>
> I've discovered is if you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year, you're only at 8,000
>
> hours.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day, from the day you are born, until the
>
> day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking, or the
>
> thought of sex with old people, of the day they're dying.
>
> But you know what makes this even more depressing, is that right here, right now, when I look
>
> at all of you wasting time listening to me, I know that all of you must suck at sex, too.
>
> It's incredible.
>
> Okay, someone here is like, "This is bullshit, I know I'm good at sex," like Mr. Leatherjacket
>
> over there.
>
> He's already got his girlfriend, his girlfriend hit me for it, wow.
>
> Listen, I'm sorry, but I hate to break this to you, but there are only two types of people
>
> that think they're good at sex, prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> You know you're a hoe.
>
> No, but, yeah, I don't know, do we have anyone here with a Swiss girlfriend?
>
> Oh, okay, yeah, we got, okay, I'm going to take these guys, because, what's your name,
>
> sir?
>
> - Janik.
>
> - Janik?
>
> - Janik.
>
> - Janik, I'm sorry, I don't know what your name for it is, and what's your name, ma'am?
>
> - Leonie.
>
> - Leonie, that's a beautiful name, beautiful couple, wow, sat on the floor, so much commitment
>
> together.
>
> You know, and I'm happy for you, because a year ago, today, on Valentine's Day, I was
>
> dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> I mean, admittedly, I had forgotten it was Valentine's Day, and now I will never forget
>
> ever again.
>
> But I did learn a lot from my Swiss girlfriend, and, you know, one of the things is I learned
>
> that Swiss women have certain key phrases, like, if Leonie says to you, she says, "Oh,
>
> shitsley, this is a good thing," this means that later on there's a high chance of sexual
>
> favors.
>
> But if she says to you, "Shuts, this is a bad thing, you should probably spend the night
>
> on the sofa," especially this sofa with these three ladies, that wouldn't be a bad decision.
>
> And if she says to you, "This is a great thing," this means she's as horny as a whore, wow.
>
> Okay, you have to think about that one a little bit.
>
> Or if she says to you, "Now, this one's a little bit confusing, but under no circumstances
>
> should you try to lick her asshole," unless she says, "This is an schiestreck," in which
>
> case you could try to lick her asshole, but you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> But, you know, okay, but, you know, so I'm single, I've been dating a bit, and, you know,
>
> dating's really hard these days.
>
> Actually, I think dating is actually especially hard for women, because I read a statistic
>
> recently that almost 50% of men between the ages of 20 and 40 sent a dick pic in the last
>
> 12 months.
>
> I'm just looking around here.
>
> This guy looks a bit dick-picky, I don't know.
>
> Yeah, but he's even prouder of the dick pics.
>
> But ladies, that might be a hard number to visualize, but, like, if you gave your number
>
> to 10 guys in this room, it's like, by Christmas time, you've got a stack of five dicks on
>
> your phone.
>
> You can just print them out, hang them from your Christmas tree, get your Christmas cards.
>
> Now, I don't take dick pics myself, believe it or not, but, and the reason for that is
>
> actually it's not because I think it's wrong, it's because I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because taking a quality dick pic, that's hard, you know, you've got to learn to think
>
> about it.
>
> You've got to think about the lighting.
>
> Do you go for some soft tone to bring out the skin color, or maybe something more red
>
> and erotic?
>
> And on Valentine's Day, do you need some props, like some roses around here?
>
> Do I want to risk pricking my dick?
>
> And it's also, it's a selfie.
>
> You've got to think about the angle.
>
> Is it like here, or here, or something like this?
>
> Luckily I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> That's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> And for you guys tonight, special offer on dickpicselfiestick.com, $29.99.
>
> But, okay, I should apologize, because, you know, I've been telling a lot of dark sexual
>
> jokes, and honestly, I think it goes back to my childhood, because when I was seven,
>
> something terrible happened.
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> Okay, judging by this reaction, not a lot of you understand circumcision.
>
> Come and talk to me after, I'll show you.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic childhood experience in adult life, has turned into
>
> a real advantage, because on those rare occasions where a woman finds her head close to the
>
> tip of my penis, she will invariably sigh, like, "Ugh."
>
> And I'll be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she will say, "You have no idea how many dirty dicks there are out there."
>
> And what I learned, what I learned is that amongst my uncut brethren, a lot of you guys
>
> are not putting in enough attention in this area.
>
> So I thought I'd just wrap up with a few tips to help you make your woman's life more pleasant,
>
> especially on Valentine's Day, that's important.
>
> So you know like in your car, you've got that wunderbaum just hanging from the rear view
>
> mirror?
>
> Just hang it from your penis.
>
> You know, women are very sensitive to smell, that will immediately make their life more
>
> pleasant.
>
> Or another thing you can do is just like up here, up above your penis, just tattoo a pleasant
>
> scene.
>
> Like a field of green grass with some flowers growing, maybe a tree with a few birds singing.
>
> Something to help take her mind off the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But looking around, I've seen you're not really believing that these are real solutions.
>
> So I've got a simpler one, a simpler one for you guys.
>
> All you've got to do is bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while she's down there, just give her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
>
> Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
>
> Oh, I love that.
>
> I love that because you know why?
>
> Because it means that no one here is getting sex tonight.
>
> And now we're all in one scene together.
>
> Woo!
>
> Wow.
>
> All right, thank you guys.
>
> Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
>
> Give it up for Harry Potter!
>
> Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
>
> Cheese likes that one thing.
>
> Okay.
