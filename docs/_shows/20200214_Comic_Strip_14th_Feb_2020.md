<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Our next performer's gonna be Harry Fox.
>
> And I have to say, I am very much disappointed
>
> that a guy looking like him, with a name like him,
>
> is not a wasted 80s porn star with a mustache.
>
> However, I am very grateful having met Harry,
>
> because whenever I'm wondering what it is with middle-aged white guys
>
> turning their weirdness into creepiness,
>
> I just give Harry a call and ask him.
>
> And whenever I cannot reach him, I'm just gonna phone Marcus.
>
> Same spectrum, same spectrum.
>
> I mean, Harry tries desperately with his comedy
>
> to be as sexy as a sweet potato.
>
> But I told him recently,
>
> "Harry, the only thing you and a sweet potato have in common
>
> "is that at some point, they're getting fried.
>
> "A sweet potato is getting more delicious,
>
> "and your skin is so fried by the sun,
>
> "you look like Donatella Versace.
>
> "And I mean Donatella now.
>
> "Not the coked-up, swollen-up 80s version of Donatella,
>
> "where you were like, 'Yeah, I'd do that,'
>
> "you know, after, like, a couple of drinks.
>
> "She's rich.
>
> "And maybe meet her brother, because I'm secretly gay,
>
> "and I'm gonna, you know,
>
> "I'm gonna meet Johnny."
>
> But no, Harry's just trying.
>
> Harry Fox, his face and his name
>
> have disappointed more women than Tiger Woods.
>
> They have disappointed more women than Sex and the City 2.
>
> They have disappointed more women than Harvey Weinstein.
>
> Too much?
>
> Have you heard the rest of the show that was soft?
>
> I'm not being mean and nasty.
>
> He can take it.
>
> He's a power bottom.
>
> I mean, really, he can take it.
>
> I mean, give him a good look and tell me
>
> you wouldn't be worried if you were driving by your child's school,
>
> slowly,
>
> in that lightly lemon-colored van,
>
> trying to sell your children candy.
>
> No, he wouldn't do that.
>
> He has two children of his own.
>
> Sadly, he didn't bring them.
>
> I wanted him to bring his son,
>
> just to show his son.
>
> You have no chance growing up normal
>
> with a father named Harry Fox.
>
> So, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> give it up for a guy
>
> who will always be overshadowed by his own name.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> I mean, am I right in feeling
>
> that the penis and the appearance of a sex offender?
>
> Yes, I am.
>
> Even if you wouldn't dare to say it
>
> because he's standing here.
>
> I dare.
>
> I state the truth.
>
> Therefore, I'm dangerous with a microphone.
>
> Give a huge round of applause for Harry again!
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family,
>
> when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> Oh, I thought it was going to be a fuck-fest.
>
> I'm sure you did.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I've had to call them "how-but" and "what-but".
>
> Just so we can get started.
>
> The real problem with a name like Harry Fox
>
> is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And that just hasn't been enough.
>
> In fact, if I can share this with you,
>
> it has actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Obviously.
>
> I'm going to write a book called "The Joy of No Sex".
>
> But, no, I hadn't realized that
>
> I was coming to the
>
> Basel Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meeting today.
>
> So, maybe if I can just explain my condition a bit,
>
> how it is when you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Because it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be walking down the street.
>
> You see a couple of dogs
>
> sniffing each other's asses.
>
> You look at them and think,
>
> "I wish that was me."
>
> Well, you go into migros.
>
> You go into migros.
>
> You spot an axion on a watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon.
>
> Maybe two.
>
> Bam!
>
> It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy.
>
> You don't care about all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this voice saying,
>
> "You're the man shaman's."
>
> You say, "Can you look?"
>
> And there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think,
>
> "She's nice."
>
> Do you know what makes this even more depressing?
>
> It's that even at my age,
>
> I don't really know if I'm any good at sex.
>
> Because I read recently,
>
> to be good at anything,
>
> it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking time.
>
> Yes, it is.
>
> I mean, if I add it all up,
>
> maybe,
>
> maybe I get to 5,000 hours
>
> if I include masturbation.
>
> But I did some maths on this,
>
> and I'm like,
>
> "I've got to figure this out."
>
> What I've discovered is
>
> if you fuck for 24 hours a day
>
> for an entire year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to 70,
>
> you need to fuck 10 times a day.
>
> From the day you are born
>
> until the day you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse about that,
>
> the idea of newborn babies fucking,
>
> or the thought of sex with old people
>
> on the day they're dying.
>
> But you know what makes this even more depressing?
>
> It's that right here, right now,
>
> when I look at all of you
>
> wasting time listening to me,
>
> I know that all of you
>
> must suck at sex, too.
>
> Okay, someone here is like,
>
> "This is bullshit.
>
> "I know I'm good at sex."
>
> Like Mr. Leather Jacket over there.
>
> He's already got his girlfriend,
>
> his girlfriend pimping for him.
>
> Wow.
>
> Listen, I'm sorry,
>
> but I hate to break this to you.
>
> There are only two types of people
>
> that think they're good at sex.
>
> Prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> You know you're a hoe.
>
> No, but, yeah, I don't know.
>
> Do we have anyone here with a Swiss girlfriend?
>
> Oh, okay.
>
> Here we go.
>
> Okay, I'm going to take these guys.
>
> What's your name, sir?
>
> Jane.
>
> Jane?
>
> Janick.
>
> Janick.
>
> Okay, Janick, whatever it is.
>
> And what's your name, ma'am?
>
> Leonie.
>
> Leonie.
>
> That's a beautiful name.
>
> Beautiful couple.
>
> Wow, sat on the floor,
>
> so much commitment together.
>
> You know, and I'm happy for you.
>
> And I'm happy for you,
>
> because a year ago today on Valentine's Day,
>
> I was dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> I mean, admittedly,
>
> I had forgotten it was Valentine's Day.
>
> And now I will never forget ever again.
>
> But I did learn a lot from my Swiss girlfriend.
>
> And, you know, one of the things is
>
> I learned that Swiss women have certain key phrases.
>
> Like if Leonie says to you, she says,
>
> "Oh, shitly, this is a good thing."
>
> This means that later on,
>
> there's a high chance of sexual favors.
>
> But if she says to you,
>
> "Shut!"
>
> This is a bad thing.
>
> You should probably spend the night on the sofa,
>
> especially this sofa with these three ladies.
>
> That wouldn't be a bad decision.
>
> And if she says to you,
>
> "Hurrakaya!"
>
> This is a great thing.
>
> This means she's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> She's as horny as a whore.
>
> And if she says to you,
>
> "Hurrakaya!"
>
> This is a great thing.
>
> This means she's as horny as a whore.
>
> Wow.
>
> Okay.
>
> You have to think about that one a little bit.
>
> Or if she says to you,
>
> "Lek mich doch amarsch!"
>
> Now, this one's a little bit confusing,
>
> but under no circumstances should you try to lick her asshole.
>
> Unless,
>
> unless she says,
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> In which case,
>
> she says,
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> Unless,
>
> unless she says,
>
> "Es ein schießtreck!"
>
> In which case,
>
> you could try to lick her asshole,
>
> but you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> But you know,
>
> okay.
>
> But you know,
>
> so I'm single.
>
> I've been,
>
> I've been dating a bit.
>
> And you know,
>
> dating's really hard these days.
>
> Actually,
>
> I think dating is actually especially hard for women.
>
> Because,
>
> I read a statistic recently,
>
> that almost 50% of women
>
> are single.
>
> I mean,
>
> if you're single,
>
> if you're in a relationship,
>
> I mean,
>
> if you're in a relationship,
>
> if you're in a relationship,
>
> if you're in a relationship,
>
> I mean,
>
> if you're in a relationship,
>
> 50% of men between the ages of 20 and 40
>
> sent a dick pic in the last 12 months.
>
> I'm just looking around here.
>
> This guy looks a bit dick picky.
>
> I don't know.
>
> Yeah,
>
> but he's even proud of the dick pics.
>
> But ladies,
>
> that might be a hard number to visualize.
>
> But like,
>
> if you gave your number to 10 guys in this room tonight,
>
> by Christmas time,
>
> you got a stack of five dicks on your phone.
>
> You can just print them out,
>
> hang them from your Christmas tree,
>
> at your Christmas class.
>
> Now,
>
> I don't take dick pics myself.
>
> Believe it or not.
>
> And the reason for that is actually,
>
> it's not because I think it's wrong,
>
> it's because I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because taking a quality dick pic,
>
> that's hard,
>
> you know.
>
> You've got to learn to think about it.
>
> You've got to think about the lighting.
