> Keep on doing these shows, okay?
>
> 5, 10, 50, if you're in finance, 100, you know what I mean?
>
> Just be loose with it now.
>
> Yes, okay, okay.
>
> Kortiki, are we ready for our last performer of the night?
>
> Yes, okay.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, you're in for a treat.
>
> This next comedian is the sexiest comedian here in Zurich.
>
> One of the hottest ones.
>
> He's originally from the UK, but he's been living here for a very long time.
>
> Kortiki, I want you guys to go wild for your last performer of the night.
>
> Harry Fuchs, everybody!
>
> Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a gentleman.
>
> It's spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> You two get this, don't you?
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> And when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, I get very upset.
>
> Because you'll think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> nothing annoys us more than you calling us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Albert and Watler.
>
> But, you know, the problem with the name, like, Harry Fuchs, is I get kind of
>
> stupid comments a lot.
>
> You know, like, recently this American tourist, he came up to me, he's like,
>
> Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fuchs. Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> And I was like, what?
>
> And he's like, yeah, Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> I'm like, hmm, okay.
>
> Let me throw him off with some adverbs, like,
>
> Harry Fuchs, hopefully.
>
> Harry Fuchs, hopefully.
>
> Harry Fuchs, okay.
>
> Occasionally.
>
> Harry Fuchs enthusiastically.
>
> But he was like, no, man, no.
>
> Harry Fuchs goats, man.
>
> Harry Fuchs chickens.
>
> Harry Fuchs tigers.
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that in the entire history of
>
> mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And what that made me realize is that there is actually a whole category
>
> of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like, like, take hippos, for example.
>
> Now, you may get up behind a hippo and think, hmm, that is a sweet ass.
>
> Don't do it.
>
> Don't do it.
>
> Hippos, they kill about 500 people every year.
>
> They're the most dangerous line of animals.
>
> Do not fuck with hippos.
>
> Another one is elephants, you know, because it's just like too high up, you
>
> know, just the average human penis can't get up there.
>
> Of course.
>
> Though, if the mum is not looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> All right, I'm just finding your level.
>
> I'm finding it.
>
> I see your core with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> I will try and stay away from that.
>
> It is true.
>
> I do have a lot of fucked up thoughts going on in my head.
>
> I apologize for that because it goes back to my childhood.
>
> See, I went, I went to a Catholic school.
>
> But I got thrown out.
>
> For molesting a priest.
>
> But, you know, actually, right here today, I am not the most fucked up person.
>
> Do you know who the most fucked up people in Zurich are?
>
> Ph.D. students, Sandra and Chris and Eric.
>
> Where are you, Chris and Eric?
>
> They've gone very quiet.
>
> Well, they left because they got fucked up shit to do.
>
> Sandra, this is for you.
>
> Because, you know, imagine.
>
> Imagine what happens when Sandra has spent all day long working on her Ph.D.
>
> thesis.
>
> And it's got to 3 a.m.
>
> She's still going.
>
> She's got a head full of, like, statistical models and equations and HIV.
>
> Now, how is she going to get to sleep?
>
> Oops, old tab.
>
> Pornhub.
>
> And, you know, the average Ph.D.
>
> Yeah, you.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I'm sorry, but the secret's out.
>
> Because, you know, the average Ph.D. takes about 8 years to complete.
>
> We're not talking good wholesome porn here, are we?
>
> We are deep into BDSM and gangbangs and dwarves riding on ponies.
>
> But imagine what happens when someone like Sandra, they get their dream job at
>
> a place like Google.
>
> And they stuff them in an office with 10 other horny Ph.D.s.
>
> Is it any surprise that last year, 30,000 Google employees walked out to
>
> protest sexual harassment at work?
>
> Because they needed to get the fuck out of there, man.
>
> It's like a fucking orgy every day with these horny Ph.D. students.
>
> But, wait.
>
> As Google is a technology company, technology is the answer.
>
> And the answer to this problem is actually kind of quite simple.
>
> But, wait. As Google is a technology company, technology is the answer. And the
>
> answer to this problem is actually kind of quite simple.
>
> But, wait. As Google is a technology company, technology is the answer. And the

>
> But, wait. As Google is a technology company, technology is the answer. And the
>
> answer to this problem is actually kind of quite simple.
>
> It's getting the technologies developing. The answer is sex robots.
>
> Now, I know that is a very awkward topic for many people, the idea of sex
>
> robots. But just think about this for a second.
>
> Imagine if Google gave all their staff sex bots.
>
> They could come out and announce and say, you know, "We rolled out sex bots to
>
> all our staff, and cases of sexual harassment have dropped by an amazing 82%."
>
> We use sexbot analytics to track employee performance.
>
> Since we rolled out sexbots, our staff are more focused and productive.
>
> You know, what we're going to see here is that sexbots are going to become
>
> mainstream.
>
> Pretty soon, everyone's going to be having them.
>
> And the big guys are going to want to get in, because this is like a billion-dollar
>
> market.
>
> Apple will be like, we brought you the iPod.
>
> We brought you the iPhone.
>
> Today, we bring you the iFuck.
>
> And Google's going to be like, shit, Apple's moving fast, man, quick.
>
> Launch the Google Ho.
>
> And then Amazon's going to be like, oh my God, okay, let's take Alexa, let's
>
> take drones.
>
> We call it the Flying Fuck.
>
> But, you know, the thing is, actually, with all technology, it solves problems,
>
> but it brings new problems.
>
> Because, you know, you're probably like, you invite some bros around, and you
>
> have some beers.
>
> And next morning, you've got to text your buddy and be like, hey, man.
>
> Last night, did you fuck my sexbot?
>
> And he's like, I'm sorry, man, I was drunk, she came on to me.
>
> And you're like, fucking hell, dude, you didn't even wash her out.
>
> We're going to, the answer is, we need sexbot security.
>
> Just swipe your dick to get it.
>
> How are we doing for time?
>
> Six months.
>
> Okay, all right.
>
> Well, let's move on to a happier subject.
>
> You know, like, like couples like Bess and Elle, you know, they're clearly so
>
> happy and so in love.
>
> But, but the thing is, for men, yeah, I love how Bess is, is grabbing Elle now.
>
> I'm going to protect you, honey.
>
> It's too late.
>
> Because, you know, when a guy falls in love with a woman, he's like, I will
>
> fight for her.
>
> I will die for her.
>
> I would even give up porn for her.
>
> Bess hasn't looked at porn for me.
>
> It'd be two and a half years, probably.
>
> But, you know, the thing is, is that when Elle fell in love with Bess, when a
>
> woman falls in love with a man,
>
> I hate to tell you this, Bess, she didn't fall in love with you.
>
> She fell in love with the idea of what she's going to do with you.
>
> Because, Bess, when you got into this relationship, let's face it, you were a
>
> mean fighting machine.
>
> You were an attack dog, a rottweiler.
>
> And Elle looked at you and was like,
>
> Hmm, how can I turn this guy into a poodle?
>
> So I can take him to brunch with my friends and go,
>
> Look what I did with this doggy-woggy.
>
> Isn't that pink ribbon cute in his hair?
>
> He doesn't even shit behind the curtains anymore.
>
> But, Bess, listen, I'm going to solve this for you.
>
> We need some advanced strategy.
>
> We need to go to one of the greatest lovers of all time.
>
> Yosef Stalin.
>
> So just think about it.
>
> What happened?
>
> Bear with me.
>
> History lesson.
>
> What happened when Germany invaded Russia?
>
> Did the Russians hold them off at the border?
>
> No, they said, Come on in.
>
> Come on, take our territories.
>
> We're not going to stop you.
>
> That's what you do, Bess.
>
> In the morning, here's what you do.
>
> You go out, one sock on your foot, other foot bare.
>
> And you do that for one morning and another.
>
> Until Elle knows.
>
> She's like, Bess, why are you only wearing one sock?
>
> And you'll be like,
>
> I didn't even notice, honey.
>
> Thank you.
>
> But then you keep on doing it.
>
> Keep going out with one sock until eventually she has to remind you every day.
>
> Then you're like, oh, thank you.
>
> Without you, I would never have cured my sock problem.
>
> And just like the Russians, it's going to be a long time before she captures
>
> any territory that you actually care about.
>
> You're going to be able to keep your PlayStation, smell your own farts, taste
>
> your own earwax.
>
> All right.
>
> Relationship fix, they think.
>
> There's another ten years in it.
>
> Thanks, guys.
>
> Hey, you guys have been fun.
>
> Yeah, that's it.
>
> Well, that was Harry Fox.
