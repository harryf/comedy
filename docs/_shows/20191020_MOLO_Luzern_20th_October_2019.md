>
> up, big round of applause, it's Harry Fox, everybody, give it up!
>
> Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs, it's a German name, it's spelled F-U-C-K-S,
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S, when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot
>
> of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids, I had to call them how-the and what-the.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is it sets a very high level
>
> of...
>
> ...expectation, and honestly, I've only really done about this much fucking,
>
> honestly, it was that much fucking, and, you know, if I can share something,
>
> you know, it's actually, unlike Chris, it's actually, for me, been quite a long
>
> time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Irish guy?
>
> Are you sure?
>
> Okay, well...
>
> Anyway, anyway, I hadn't realized I was coming to this Nymphomaniacs Anonymous
>
> meet-up, but maybe to help you understand my condition, what it's like when you
>
> haven't had sex for a long time, it's kind of like, like, you could be walking
>
> down the street, and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses, and
>
> you look at them and you think, um, I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into Mikro.
>
> You go into Mikro.
>
> And you spot an action on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two, and bam, it's like you're in a
>
> new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon, you're just getting hot, getting steamy, you're
>
> oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this, "Jungermann, schämen Sie sich nicht!"
>
> And you look, and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag, and you
>
> think, uh, she's nice.
>
> But, uh, it actually gets worse, because, you know, I've been thinking about
>
> this quite a lot, and I actually realized that even at this age, I don't know
>
> if I'm any good at sex.
>
> 'Cause I read recently that to be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> Now, I've done the math for you.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.

> If you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year, you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you were born
>
> until the day you die.
>
> And what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking?
>
> Or the idea of sex with old people on the day they're dying?

> you, man. But, you know, you're probably wondering, like, okay, here's this guy.
>
> He talks about
>
> sex a lot. Why?
>
> Why is this? Well, actually, I think it goes back to my childhood because when
>
> I was about
>
> seven, something was taken from me. That's right. I was circumcised. Now,
>
> judging by
>
> that reaction, a lot of you don't seem to know what circumcision is. Come and
>
> talk to
>
> me after. I'll show you. But, you see, what began for me as a very traumatic
>
> childhood
>
> experience in adult life has turned into a very traumatic childhood experience
>
> in adult
>
> life has turned into a real advantage because on those rare occasions that a
>
> woman's head
>
> comes close to the tip of my penis, she will invariably sigh, like, "Oh." And I'll
>
> be like,
>
> "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?" And she'll be like, "You have no idea
>
> how many
>
> dirty dicks there are out there." Yeah, I know. And what I learned, actually,
>
> is amongst
>
> my uncut brethren, there's a lot of dirty dicks that are out there. I mean,
>
> there's
>
> a lot of things that are out there. There's a lot of dirty dicks that are out
>
> there.
