<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Okay, okay, ladies and gentlemen, we only have one last act left in our first act.
>
> Okay, you guys are in for a treat.
>
> Okay, this is a comedian, he's never been here in Lutzer before.
>
> This is his very first time, so we're very excited for him, okay?
>
> Now, I want to bring him up on stage.
>
> I have to say, though, so his name, this is his real name, okay, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Give it up, big round of applause, it's Harry Fox, everybody, give it up!
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Howler and Whatler.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fux is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And honestly, I've only really done about this much fucking.
>
> Honestly, it was that much fucking.
>
> And, you know, if I can share something, you know, it's actually, unlike Chris,
>
> it's actually, for me, been quite a long time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Irish guy?
>
> You sure?
>
> Okay, well, anyway, anyway, I hadn't realized I was coming to this Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meet-up.
>
> But maybe to help you understand my condition, what it's like when you haven't had sex for a long
>
> time,
>
> it's kind of like, you could be walking down the street and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each
>
> other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think, "I wish that wasn't me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, you go into Migros and you spot an Accionon watermelon.
>
> And you go, "One hand on that watermelon. Maybe two."
>
> And BAM, it's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> You are that watermelon. You're just getting hot, getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this, "Junge Mann! Schemen sie sich nicht!"
>
> And you look, and there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think, "She's nice."
>
> But it actually gets worse because, you know, I've been thinking about this quite a lot.
>
> And I actually realized that even at this age, I don't know if I'm any good at sex.
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> Now I've done the math, the math teacher will be very proud of me.
>
> If you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year, you own your 8,000 hours.
>
> If you live to 70, you need to fuck 10 times a day.
>
> From the day you were born until the day you die.
>
> And what's worse about that? The idea of newborn babies fucking?
>
> Or the idea of sex with old people on the day they're dying?
>
> But at this point, someone here is thinking, "This is bullshit. I know I'm good at sex."
>
> Like, "Chris, the Greek man here, I'm a Greek man. I'm good at sex."
>
> Chris, I hate to break this to you.
>
> There are only two types of people that think that.
>
> Prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> Stop lying, Chris. You know you're a ho.
>
> Let's just take a quick time out here because I'm actually a bit puzzled by what's going on here.
>
> So this is your 973rd date. Paulina, what is going on here?
>
> If he is at least half as good at sex as he thinks he is, you are missing out.
>
> You need to take him out of the friend zone, Paulina. Tonight is the night.
>
> Chris, I did what I could for you, man.
>
> But you're probably wondering, "Okay, here's this guy. He talks about sex a lot. Why is this?"
>
> Well, actually, I think it goes back to my childhood.
>
> Because when I was about seven, something was taken from me.
>
> That's right. I was circumcised.
>
> Now, judging by that reaction, a lot of you don't seem to know what circumcision is.
>
> Come and talk to me after. I'll show you.
>
> But you see, what began for me as a very traumatic childhood experience in adult life has turned
>
> into a real advantage.
>
> Because on those rare occasions that a woman's head comes close to the tip of my penis,
>
> she will invariably sigh like, "Oh."
>
> And I'll be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'll be like, "You have no idea how many dirty dicks there are out there."
>
> Yeah, I know. And what I learned, actually, is that amongst my uncut brethren like Chris,
>
> a lot of these guys are not putting enough attention in this area.
>
> Paulina, maybe you're making the right choice.
>
> But, Chris, I've got a few tips for you so that you can make Paulina's experience pleasant.
>
> Like, Chris, you know you have in your car like a wunderbaum?
>
> Just take it, hang it from your penis.
>
> Women are very sensitive to smell. That will immediately make her life more pleasant.
>
> Another thing you could think about, though, is right here, up above your penis,
>
> just try tattooing a pleasant scene like a field of green grass with some flowers growing.
>
> Maybe a tree with a few birds singing.
>
> Something to take her mind off the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But there is actually even a simple thing that might be too hard for you, Chris,
>
> so let's go for the simple solution.
>
> Just bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while she's down there, just feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> I'm sorry, Chris, I fucked it up for you.
>
> No one here is getting any sex tonight.
>
> But you guys have been great. Thank you very much.
>
> And give it up again. That was Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> Wow, so we definitely all learned a little bit about each other in this half.
