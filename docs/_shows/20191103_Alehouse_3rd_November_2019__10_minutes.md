>
> fuckers and I have two kids I had to call them how the and what the to give

>
> that makes me very nervous I'm much more happy with these guys the the kind of
>
> the Alpine grinder experience maybe we should call that at Brokeback Mountain
>
> but you know I mean for me for me I just found actually after trying tinder that
>
> it was a really bad idea because for most of you guys most you are under 30
>
> for you guys tinder is an amazing place because you get to swipe your way
>
> through hot sexy bodies and potential erotic encounters and the dream the
>
> dream that your prince might somewhere be in here your perfect man but for me
>
> tinder over 40 is a dark place I have to swipe my way through broken
>
> marriages drug and alcohol problems faded tattoos say no regrets it's really
>
> brutal you know and and it makes me wonder ladies what is it that happens
>
> you into the next 10 to 15 years that leads to your lives being destroyed was
>
> it was it maybe that prince you found on tinder it's kind of scary but to me
>
> actually the scariest thing about all the tinder is the sight of a 50 year
>
> old woman making a duck face I mean how the fuck do you get to 50 years thinking
>
> that a duck face is okay the only time that a duck face is ever okay is when
>
> both your parents are ducks and ducks only live about 10 years the universe
>
> had no plan for 50 year old duck face but you know I got a message from one
>
> lady she was 52 and she sent me this message it said with those cute blue
>
> eyes how is it you're still running around free now aside from that being
>
> the worst chat up line I think I've ever heard imagine if I was to say that to
>
> any woman here you shouldn't be running around free you should be tied up in my
>
> dungeon holy shit this is some scary stuff and what it made me realize is
>
> that all the women they don't really know how to chat up men they have zero
>
> gain because for all these years men have been coming up to their men have
>
> been getting all the practice but you know now things are getting a bit saggy
>
> you know men aren't showing as much interest as they were once upon a time
>
> and you know and what I read which is even more disturbing is that as women
>
> get older apparently their sex drive increases yeah so what we're saying is
>
> is that they have zero game they're super horny and no one really wants to
>
> fuck them I know it's really and there I thought I need to solve this problem I
>
> need to fix this I feel bad about this and we need a solution to this and then
>
> it hit me we need another group that has zero game is super horny and that no one
>
> really wants to fuck and that's why I've launched an app called teen dogs teenage
>
> boys we saw this thing out for the older ladies oh we're getting some we're
>
> getting some awkwardness here they're like oh I don't like this idea of all
>
> the women and teenage boys you know I just saw a 19 year old girl so yeah I
>
> think we're all good here so yeah let me tell you let me tell you a little story
>
> though so recently I had a bit of a strange experience because I was walking
>
> down Badener Straße like over there in the cool part of Zurich where the
>
> hipsters live and this young man came past me on his bicycle on his hipster
>
> bicycle and he looked me in the eye and did this and I was like first actually
>
> quite impressed because he was right next to the tram track he managed to
>
> pull that off without wiping out but then I thought this young man is
>
> completely right I am a first-class masturbator my hand and my penis is a
>
> love affair of over 40 years that's longer than most of you have been on the
>
> planet you know my hand knows amazing things about my penis and it it's
>
> reached the point if I go on a date with a lady I'm like yeah she's kind of cute
>
> but could she beat my hand because you know my hand my hand is not trying to
>
> post every moment on Instagram my hand is not trying to take me to brunch with
>
> its friends you know my hand does not even want babies one day you know and
>
> when I think about this like my hand it's just so perfect you know if I bring
>
> it together with the other hand it's a perfect ten but you know and and so but
