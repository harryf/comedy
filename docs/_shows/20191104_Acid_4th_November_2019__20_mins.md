> You might have seen him before, he's been in our scene for a while, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> and this is his real name.
>
> Give it up, it's Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux, it's a German name, spelt F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Because in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a
>
> group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids, and I had to call them "how the" and "what the".
>
> But you see, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox, it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> Because if my name was Harry Fox, I probably would have come on here tonight and been like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fox in the house!"
>
> But that's not really me, I'm kind of quiet.
>
> And I get a lot of people saying stupid stuff to me.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up to me, and he's like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, Harry Fox? But Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> I'm like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Exactly, Harry Fox what?"
>
> And I'm like, "OK, I can throw him off with some adverbs, Harry Fux, hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fox occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fox enthusiastically."
>
> But he was like, "No, man, no. Harry Fox goats, man. Harry Fox chickens. Harry Fox tigers."
>
> Now I'm pretty sure that in the whole history of mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And it made me realize that there is actually a whole category of unfuckable animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> Like Enrico. You may get up behind a hippo and be like,
>
> "That is a cute ass on a hippo."
>
> Don't do it, Enrico, because hippos, they are the most dangerous land mammals.
>
> They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Or elephants. Elephants, because it's just too high up.
>
> You just can't reach.
>
> Of course, if the mind isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> I'm just finding your level, OK?
>
> I'm getting that you're OK with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> I'm trying to tune the set.
>
> So I'm having a bit of a problem in my life right now.
>
> Because, honestly, if I can share this with you, it's been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Do you need me to define "long time" like more than 60 seconds?
>
> This lady's going, "I hadn't realized that I was coming to the zero nymphomaniac synopsis."
>
> That's great with you. We'll have something that connects you.
>
> So maybe to help you understand a little bit of the condition I'm in.
>
> When you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street and you see a couple of dogs.
>
> And they're sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Miro and you smell an action of watermelon.
>
> You get like one hand on that watermelon.
>
> Maybe two.
>
> And bam! It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon. It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy. You're oblivious to all the people.
>
> And then you hear this, "You're a man! Shame on you!"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady.
>
> And she's about to hit you with that handbag.
>
> And you think, "She's nice."
>
> But you know, it actually gets worse than this.
>
> Because recently I got to thinking,
>
> How do I know, even at this age, if I'm any good at sex?
>
> Because I read something that said,
>
> To be good at anything, it takes 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> I mean, I've done the maths on this.
>
> Do you know, if you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year,
>
> You're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> And this makes me very depressed.
>
> Because when I come here to a night like tonight,
>
> And all of you guys are wasting time to listen to me,
>
> I just know that all of you must suck at sex too.
>
> We're just a room of nymphomaniacs that suck at sex.
>
> It's really terrible.
>
> Because, you know, more maths on this.
>
> If you live to 70 years old,
>
> You need to fuck 10 times a day,
>
> From the day you were born until the day you die.
>
> And I know what's worse about that.
>
> If it's the idea of newborn babies fucking,
>
> Or the idea of sex with old people,
>
> On the day they're dying.
>
> Okay, we've come to a very dark place.
>
> They're thinking about their grandmothers having sex right now.
>
> That's a very awkward image.
>
> But, you know, at some point,
>
> Probably at this point, someone here is thinking,
>
> I just don't believe this.
>
> I know I'm good at sex.
>
> Enrique, for example.
>
> With a name like that, of course I am good at sex.
>
> Enrique, I'm sorry to break this to you.
>
> There are only two types of people that think they're good at sex.
>
> Prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> Stop lying, Enrico.
>
> You know you're a ho!
>
> Natalia, you know, she's locked up.
>
> This could be something special.
>
> Let's go somewhere else quickly.
>
> Alright, so, you know.
>
> Let me see, we've got a lot of couples here tonight.
>
> But they're not couples, you know.
>
> We've got these two.
>
> There's something very strange and undefined.
>
> Maybe the problem is that simply,
>
> The issue that men and women,
>
> We don't really understand what the opposite side likes about sex.
>
> Are you with me on that?
>
> We don't really understand.
>
> Do you think you know what I like about sex?
>
> She has no idea.
>
> And I have no idea what you would like either.
>
> And this is a fundamental problem that genders have.
>
> And I was thinking about this problem for a while.
>
> And I realized that there is actually a simple solution to this problem.
>
> All you have to do is take a number three tram through Zurich.
>
> If you take a number three tram, it's going to take you to places that will blow your mind.
>
> Because first of all, that tram is going to stop outside Sensuelle.
>
> Now, Sensuelle is a sex shop for ladies.
>
> It's full of feathers and aromas and erotic literature and sexy underwear.
>
> Because for women, a lot about what makes sex enjoyable is what's happening in their heads.
>
> In their heads, you know.
>
> I guess that means I need to put my dick in their mouth.
>
> Okay, we have a laugh out of that one.
>
> These people do have some darkness in them.
>
> Let's quickly get back on the tram going through Zurich.
>
> Alright, so we carry on on that number three tram.
>
> You carry on, you enter the sex shop for ladies, you keep on going.
>
> Eventually, that tram is going to stop outside a sex shop for men.
>
> A sex shop called The Erotic Factory.
>
> Because for men, a lot about what makes sex enjoyable is...
>
> Oh, I've just totally blown this joke now.
>
> Let's just move on from all of that.
>
> Oh, Jesus Christ.
>
> Alright, so we're here at this English comedy night.
>
> You're listening to me. I'm originally from England.
>
> I've been in Switzerland for a long time now.
>
> I'm actually in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> When I get my passport, I'm going to be voting Esparpille.
>
> Because it's time to do something about all the immigrants.
>
> Specifically, I mean the English-speaking immigrants.
>
> Let's take a look at these guys.
>
> What have they done when they came here?
>
> Because they voted for Trump. They voted for Brexit.
>
> And then they were like, "Oh my God, we fucked up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> But when they came here, you've got to ask, "What are they actually voting for?"
>
> Because when the Indians and the Vietnamese came here, they brought with them great cuisine.
>
> Or the Romanians and the Brazilians, when they came here, they brought sexual relief.
>
> But these English speakers are just coming to comedy nights like this
>
> and listening to stand-up comedy in English and not even learning the language.
>
> And it bothers me.
>
> All right, so where are we going to go from here?
>
> When you live here 18 years, you actually start to feel like you belong here.
>
> For me, actually, when I think about it, I think of all the foreigners.
>
> I think it is my job to help prevent this country from getting stolen.
>
> Because the Swiss people, they're all unemployed.
>
> They don't want to do anything.
>
> So it's down to me.
>
> And I think this actually goes back to my childhood.
>
> Because when I was 7 years old, something was stolen from me.
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> And judging by that reaction, not a lot of you know what circumcision means.
>
> Come and talk to me afterwards, I'll show you.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic childhood experience in adult life has turned into a real
>
> advantage.
>
> Because on those rare occasions that a woman's head comes close to the tip of my penis,
>
> and I mean closer than this, it's a lot closer,
>
> she would invariably sigh like [sigh]
>
> and I'd be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'd be like, "You have no idea how many dirty dicks I have."
>
> And what I learned is that amongst my uncut brethren,
>
> a lot of you are not putting in enough attention in this area.
>
> So I thought I'd give you a few tips to help you keep your lady's life more pleasant.
>
> For example, you know in your car you've got that wunderbaum hanging from the rear view mirror?
>
> Just hang that from your penis.
>
> Because women are very sensitive to smell.
>
> That will immediately make her life more pleasant.
>
> Or hang up and word with Nadia. Nadia here is looking like she regrets even coming here tonight.
>
> How's it going for you, Nadia?
>
> I'm fine, thanks.
>
> You're fine, thanks. Okay, this has got more awkward for you now.
>
> Well, we've brought some awkwardness into your evening.
>
> Alright, let's carry on because, you know,
>
> with more tips for what you can do to make your lady's life more pleasant,
>
> because what you could also do is right here, up above your penis,
>
> you could try tattooing a pleasant scene, like a field of green grass with some flowers growing,
>
> or maybe a tree with a few birds singing.
>
> You know, something to help take her mind off the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But, yeah, this is going fantastic.
>
> Let me just have a sip of this while people deal with their trauma.
>
> This is your trauma break.
>
> Okay, so those tips might have been a little bit hard to grasp.
>
> So let's try something a bit simpler.
>
> All you've got to do is, when she's down there, you just bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while she's down there, you just kind of feed her the crackers.
>
> Because she gets really well with crackers.
>
> Oh, this is going great. This is fantastic.
>
> Should I do some more? We've got more time.
>
> Alright, let's switch them.
>
> Amit is ready to give up comedy forever at this point.
>
> Me, I don't give a fuck, you know. I'm enjoying myself.
>
> You guys are. I'm having fun.
>
> Alright, so let me tell you something.
>
> Amazingly, and probably someone should call social services,
>
> amazingly, I'm actually a single dad. I have two teenage kids.
>
> And they live with me.
>
> Being a single dad is hard because there's many things to deal with.
>
> And especially technology.
>
> Because technology brings in a lot of things that are very difficult.
>
> Like parents, 20 years ago, they didn't have to worry about this.
>
> Like, my son plays Fortnite.
>
> Do you guys know what Fortnite is?
>
> Let me just explain that quickly.
>
> Fortnite is a shooter you play online against other people.
>
> And recently, the makers of Fortnite
>
> announced that they had 125 million players online at the same time.
>
> To so many kids, they're saying they're ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me as a parent,
>
> I think actually Fortnite is teaching my son some great life skills.
>
> Because he's learned to sit in a chair without moving, eating,
>
> or going to the toilet for eight hours.
>
> Which I think is great preparation for future office life.
>
> And his English has improved dramatically.
>
> He's learned some key phrases like,
>
> "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> Or, "I will piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> And this makes me proud as a father.
>
> But we've already gone into dark places though,
>
> back into a dark place, because it gets even worse.
>
> Recently, I managed to catch my son by accident looking at porn.
>
> And I was very shocked.
>
> But luckily, I'm a bit of an expert,
>
> so I can point him at all the best categories.
>
> And we came up with an agreement.
>
> We said, right now, we're going for boobs and asses,
>
> and maybe some blowjobs.
>
> You know, like safe stuff for a kid his age.
>
> For his birthday though, we're going to give him lesbians,
>
> because it's important for men.
>
> It's important for men.
>
> That just threw me off completely.
>
> I think it's important, like lesbians,
>
> because it's important that men have some fantasies
>
> about things they will never see in their life.
>
> But also, the thing that I'm thinking is that
>
> when he gets dumped by his first girlfriend,
>
> that is the correct time to introduce choking and deep throat.
>
> That's good.
>
> It's important to be a responsible parent.
>
> That's the basic message I'm telling you here.
>
> I also have a teenage daughter though.
>
> I can sense the excitement about this right now.
>
> And the thing about having a teenage daughter is,
>
> because with a son I kind of get where he's coming from,
>
> but with a teenage daughter,
>
> I am constantly being confronted with situations
>
> I was wholly unprepared for.
>
> Recently, I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom,
>
> and oh my God, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was like a bloody handprint in the mirror,
>
> drops of blood in the sink,
>
> all blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming,
>
> and I looked around,
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter showed up and said,
>
> "Hey Dad, I got my period."
>
> So after cleaning up my daughter's menstrual blood,
>
> I was like, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> So I thought, "Hm, okay."
>
> As a man, I have zero qualifications for this,
>
> but it can't be so hard.
>
> So I went back to Migo wearing a wig.
>
> And I took a look around,
>
> and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like OB Pro.
>
> Like, what is this?
>
> Like, for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> That doesn't sound like something I want to get my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> What, like glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> Get it in with the lights off?
>
> The one I liked the most, I thought was very creative,
>
> was Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It is fantastic.
>
> Right about ten o'clock, it's Salsa League,
>
> and she is always home by eleven.
>
> And for me, this whole experience as a father,
>
> it was a very proud one.
>
> Because it's not every day you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> Ah, I loved this tonight.
>
> Thank you very much. I think I'm done there before you.
