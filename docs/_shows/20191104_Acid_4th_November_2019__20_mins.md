> You might have seen him before. He's been in our scene for a while, ladies and
>
> gentlemen, and this is his real name.
>
> Give it up, it's Harry Fox, everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name, it's spelled F-U-C-K-S, I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Been in a room with English speakers like this all over, you'd think my name is
>
> Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Because in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> I have two kids, and I had to call them Halbert.
>
> And what the?
>
> But you see, the real problem with it, being like Harry Fox, it sets a very
>
> high level of expectation.
>
> Because if my name was Harry Fox, I probably would have come on here tonight
>
> and been like,
>
> Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fox in the house!
>
> But that's not really me, I'm kind of quiet.
>
> And I get a lot of people saying stupid stuff to me.
>
> Like recently, this American tourist came up to me, and he's like,
>
> Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fox in the house.
>
> Yo, what's up, Harry Fox? But Harry Fox what, man?
>
> I'm like, what? He's like, exactly, Harry Fox what?
>
> And I'm like, okay, I can throw him off with some adverbs.
>
> Harry Fox, hopefully.
>
> Harry Fox occasionally.
>
> Harry Fox enthusiastically.
>
> But he was like, no, man, no.
>
> Harry Fox goats, man. Harry Fox chickens. Harry Fox tigers.
>
> Now, I'm pretty sure that in the whole history of mankind,
>
> no one has ever successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> And it made me realize that there is actually a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> You know, like Enrico.
>
> You may get up behind a hippo and be like,
>
> That is a cute ass on that hippo.
>
> Don't do it, Enrico.
>
> Don't do it, Enrico.
>
> Don't do it, Enrico.
>
> Because hippos, they are the most dangerous land mammals.
>
> They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Or, you know, elephants.
>
> Elephants, because it's just too high up.
>
> You know, you just can't reach.
>
> Of course, if the mind isn't looking, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> All right, I'm just finding your level, okay?
>
> I'm getting that you're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> I'm trying to tune the set.
>
> So, I'm having a little bit of a problem in my life right now.
>
> Because, honestly, if I can share this with you, it's been a long time since I've
>
> had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Do you need me to define long time?
>
> Like more than 60 seconds?
>
> This lady is getting...
>
> I hadn't realized that I was coming to the zero.
>
> I'm sure if nymphomaniacs are not listening to me, it's great that you all have
>
> something that connects you.
>
> Well, so, maybe to help you understand a little bit of the condition I'm in.
>
> You know, like when you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're
>
> hallucinating.
>
> Because, you know, you could be walking down the street and you see a couple of
>
> dogs.
>
> And they're sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think, I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into the middle and you smell an axion of watermelon.
>
> You get like one hand on that watermelon.
>
> Maybe two.
>
> And bam, it's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to all the people.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> You're my man, shame on you.
>
> And you look and there's an old lady.
>
> And she's about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think, she's nice.
>
> But, you know, it actually, it actually gets worse than this.
>
> Because, you know, recently I got to thinking, like, how do I know, even at
>
> this age, if I'm any good at sex?
>
> You know, because I read something that said, to be good at anything, it takes
>
> 10,000 hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> I mean, I've done the math.
>
> I've done the math on this, right?
>
> And, you know, like, if you fuck for 24 hours a day for an entire year, you're
>
> only at 8,000 hours.
>
> You know, and, you know, this makes me very depressed.
>
> Because when I come here to a night like tonight, and all of you guys are
>
> wasting time to listen to me,
>
> I just know that all of you must suck at sex too.
>
> We're just a room of nymphomaniacs that suck at sex.
>
> It's really...
>
> It's really terrible.
>
> Because, you know, more maths on this, okay?
>
> If you live to 70 years old, you need to fuck 10 times a day from the day you
>
> were born until the day you die.
>
> And I know what's worse about that.
>
> If it's the idea of newborn babies fucking, or the idea of sex with old people
>
> on the day they're dying.
>
> Okay, we're going to talk very dark.
>
> This guy is very, I don't know, they're thinking about their grandmothers
>
> having sex right now.
>
> That's a very awkward image.
>
> But, you know, at some point, probably at this point, someone here is thinking,
>
> I just don't believe this.
>
> Like, I know I'm good at sex.
>
> Like Enrique, for example.
>
> He's like, with a name like that, of course I am good at sex.
>
> Enrique, I'm sorry to break this to you.
>
> There are only two types of people that think they're good at sex.
>
> Prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> Stop lying, Enrico.
>
> You know you're a hoe.
>
> Natalia, you know, yeah, she's locked up.
>
> Like, this could be something special.
>
> Okay, let's go somewhere else quickly.
>
> All right, so, you know, let me see.
>
> We've got a lot of couples here tonight.
>
> A lot of, but they're not couples, you know.
>
> We've got these two, we've got these.
>
> There's something very strange and undefined.
>
> And maybe, like, maybe the problem is that simply that, you know, the issue
>
> that men and women,
>
> we don't really understand what the opposite side likes about sex.
>
> Are you with me on that?
>
> We don't really understand.
>
> Do you think you know what I like about sex?
>
> She has no idea.
>
> Because, and I have no idea what you would like either.
>
> Because, and this is the fundamental problem that genders have.
>
> And I was thinking.
>
> I was thinking about this problem for a while, and I realized that there is
>
> actually a simple solution to this problem.
>
> All you have to do is take a number three tram through Zurich.
>
> If you take a number three tram, it's going to take you to places that will
>
> blow your mind.
>
> Because, first of all, that tram is going to stop outside Sensuelle.
>
> Now, Sensuelle is a sex shop for ladies.
>
> It's full of feathers and aromas and erotic literature and sex.
>
> It's the only way.
>
> Because for women, a lot about what sex, what makes sex enjoyable is what's
>
> happening in their heads.
>
> In their heads, you know.
>
> I guess that means I need to put my dick in their mouth.
>
> Okay, we're going to laugh at it.
>
> These people do have some darkness in them.
>
> Let's quickly get back on the tram going through Zurich.
>
> All right, so we carry on on that number three tram.
>
> You carry on.
>
> You went to the sex shop for ladies.
>
> You keep on going.
>
> Eventually, that tram is going to stop outside a sex shop for men.
>
> A sex shop called the Erotic Factory.
>
> Because for men, a lot about what makes sex enjoyable is...
>
> Oh, I've just totally blown this joke now.
>
> Let's just move on from all of that.
>
> Okay.
>
> Oh, Jesus Christ.
>
> So, all right.
>
> So, you know.
>
> We're here at this English comedy night.
>
> And, you know, you're listening to me.
>
> I'm originally from England.
>
> I've been in Switzerland for a long time now.
>
> And I'm actually in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> And when I get my passport, I'm going to be voting S-file B.
>
> Because it's time to do something about all the immigrants.
>
> And specifically, I mean the English-speaking immigrants, you know.
>
> Because let's take a look at these guys.
>
> Like, what have they...
>
> What have they done when they came here, you know?
>
> Because, you know, they voted for Trump.
>
> They voted for Brexit.
>
> And then they were like,
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> We fucked up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland.
>
> But when they came here, you've got to ask,
>
> What are they actually bringing?
>
> Because, you know, when the Indians and the Vietnamese came here,
>
> they brought with them great cuisine.
>
> Or the Romanians and the Brazilians,
>
> when they came here,
>
> they brought sexual relief.
>
> But, you know, these English speakers are just coming to comedy nights like
>
> this
>
> and listening to sound-up comedy in English
>
> and not even learning the language, you know.
>
> And it bothers me.
>
> I got to go.
>
> For some unknown reason.
>
> All right.
>
> So, where are we going to go from here?
>
> Okay.
>
> So, you know, when you live here 18 years,
>
> you actually...
>
> You start to feel like you belong here, you know.
>
> And for me, actually, when I think about it,
>
> I think of all the foreigners.
>
> I think it is my job to help prevent this country from getting stolen.
>
> Because, you know, the Swiss people, they're all unemployed.
>
> They don't want to do anything.
>
> So, it's down to me.
>
> And, you know, I think this actually goes back to my childhood.
>
> Because when I was seven years old,
>
> something was stolen from me.
>
> That's right.
>
> I was circumcised.
>
> And, you know, judging by that reaction,
>
> not a lot of you know what circumcision means.
>
> Come and talk to me afterwards.
>
> I'll show you.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic childhood experience
>
> in adult life has sent me to a real advantage.
>
> Because on those rare occasions
>
> that a woman's head comes close to the tip of my penis,
>
> and I mean closer than this, you know,
>
> it's a lot closer,
>
> she would invariably sigh, like...
>
> And I'd be like,
>
> "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'd be like,
>
> "You have no idea how many dirty dicks I have there."
>
> And what I learned, what I learned is that
>
> amongst my uncut brethren,
>
> a lot of you are not putting in enough attention in this area, you know.
>
> So, I thought I'd give you a few tips
>
> to help you keep your lady's life more pleasant, you know.
>
> For example, you know in your car that you've got that wunderbaum?
>
> Paint it from the rear view mirror.
>
> Just hang that from your penis.
>
> 'Cause women are very sensitive to smell.
>
> That will immediately make her life more pleasant.
>
> Or, hang up that word with Nadia.
>
> Nadia here is looking like she regrets even coming here tonight.
>
> Well, how's it going for you, Nadia?
>
> I'm fine, thanks.
>
> You're fine, thanks.
>
> Okay, this has gotten more awkward for you now.
>
> Well, we've brought some awkwardness into your evening.
>
> All right, let's carry on because, you know,
>
> with more tips for what you can do today,
>
> to make your lady's life more pleasant,
>
> because what you could also do is right here,
>
> up above your penis,
>
> you could try tattooing a pleasant scene,
>
> like a field of green grass with some flowers growing,
>
> or maybe a tree with a few birds singing.
>
> You know, something to help take her mind off
>
> the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But, yeah, it's...
>
> This is going fantastically.
>
> Let me just have a sip of this while people deal with their trauma.
>
> This is your trauma break.
>
> Okay, so those tips might have been a little bit hard to grasp,
>
> so let's try something a bit simpler.
>
> All you've got to do is, when she's down there,
>
> you just bring a box of crackers.
>
> And while she's down there, you just kind of feed her the crackers.
>
> Because cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> Oh, wow!
>
> Oh, this is going great!
>
> This is fantastic.
>
> I mean, should I do some more?
>
> We've got more time.
>
> All right, let's switch them.
>
> I mean, it's really to give up comedy forever at this point.
>
> Me, I don't give a fuck.
>
> You know, I'm enjoying myself.
>
> You guys are having fun.
>
> All right, so let me tell you something.
>
> So, like, amazingly,
>
> and probably someone should call social services,
>
> amazingly, I'm actually a single dad.
>
> I have two teenage kids, and they live with me.
>
> And being a single dad is hard
>
> because, you know, there's many things to deal with,
>
> and especially technology, you know,
>
> because technology brings in a lot of things
>
> that are very difficult.
>
> Like, parents 20 years ago, they didn't have to worry about this, you know?
>
> Like, my son plays Fortnite.
>
> Do you guys know what Fortnite is?
>
> Let me just explain them quickly.
>
> Like, Fortnite is a shooter you can play online against other people.
>
> And recently, the makers of Fortnite announced
>
> that they had 125 million players online at the same time.
>
> So, so many kids are saying they're ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me, as a parent,
>
> I think, actually, Fortnite is teaching my son some great life skills.
>
> Because he's learned to sit in a chair without moving, eating,
>
> or going to the toilet for eight hours.
>
> Which I think is great preparation for future office life.
>
> And his English has improved dramatically, you know?
>
> Like, he's learned some key phrases like,
>
> "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> Or, "I will piss on you like Donald Trump," you know?
>
> And he's made so proud as a father.
>
> Well, we've already gone into dark places, though,
>
> so let's go back into a dark place
>
> because it gets even worse.
>
> Recently, recently,
>
> I managed to catch my son by accident looking at porn.
>
> And I was very shocked.
>
> But luckily, I'm a bit of an expert,
>
> so I could point him at all the best categories.
>
> And we came up with an agreement.
>
> We said, you know, like, right now,
>
> okay, we're going for, like, boobs and asses
>
> and maybe some blowjobs, you know?
>
> Like, safe stuff for a kid his age.
>
> For his birthday, though, we're going to give him lesbians
>
> because it's important for men.
>
> It's important for men.
>
> That just threw me off completely there.
>
> No, I think it's important.
>
> Like, lesbians, because, you know,
>
> it's important that men have some fantasies
>
> about things they will never see in their life.
>
> And, you know, and it gets...
>
> But also, like, the thing that I'm thinking is
>
> that when he gets dumped by his first girlfriend,
>
> that is the correct time
>
> to introduce choking and deep throat, you know?
>
> That's good.
>
> It's important to be a responsible parent.
>
> That's the basic message I'm telling you here.
>
> I also have a teenage daughter, though.
>
> Oh, I can sense the excitement about this right now.
>
> And the thing about having a teenage daughter is even...
>
> Because with a son, I kind of get where he's coming from,
>
> but with a teenage daughter,
>
> I'm constantly being confronted with situations
>
> I was wholly unprepared for.
>
> Like, recently, I came back from work,
>
> I went into the bathroom,
>
> and, oh, my God, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was, like, a bloody handprint in the mirror,
>
> drops of blood in the sink,
>
> and all blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming,
>
> and I looked around...
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from him.
>
> At that moment, my daughter showed up and said,
>
> "Hey, Dad, I got my period."
>
> So after cleaning up my daughter's menstrual blood,
>
> I was like, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> So I thought, "Hmm, okay."
>
> As a man, I have zero qualifications,
>
> but it can't be so hard.
>
> So I went back to Migo wearing a wig.
>
> And I thought, "Oh, my God.
>
> "I'm wearing a wig."
>
> And I took a look around,
>
> and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like "OB Pro."
>
> Like, what is this, like,
>
> for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> It doesn't sound like something I want to get my daughter.
>
> Or "Tampax Radiance."
>
> What, like, glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> Get it in with the lights off?
>
> The one I liked the most, I thought was very crazy,
>
> was "Always Infinity."
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called "Always Home by 11."
>
> It is fantastic.
>
> Around about 10 o'clock, it starts to leak,
>
> and she is always home by 11.
>
> And for me, this whole experience as a father,
>
> it was a very proud one.
>
> Because it's not every day you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> Ah, I love this tonight.
>
> Thank you very much.
>
> I think I'm done there.
>
> Okay, that was Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> He's a great person.
