> love this next comedian he's very funny he's originally british but he's he's
>
> been living
>
> here in switzerland for a very long time he's done this open mic before ladies
>
> and gentlemen
>
> your last performer of tonight make some noise for harry fox everybody
>
> so my name is actually harry books it's a german name it's spelled f u c k s i
>
> repeat f u c k s
>
> when i'm in a room with english speakers like this a lot of you think my name
>
> is harry fox
>
> my name is not harry fox in my family when we have a family get-together
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers
>
> and i have two kids i had to call them how the and what the
>
> but uh you know the real problem with a name like harry fox is it sets a very
>
> high level
>
> of expectation and i've only really done like this much back in fact in fact
>
> recently i'm
>
> going through a bit of a hard time because i was recently dumped by my first swiss
>
> girlfriend
>
> and uh you know it was a very traumatic experience but on the upside it did
>
> make me an expert on all swiss women yeah and what i what i've learned i've
>
> learned a lot about swiss
>
> women for example they're very bad at communicating especially when it comes to
>
> their men and the
>
> reason for this is that switzerland has a very poor track record on women's
>
> rights
>
> because it was not until 1991 that the last canton of appenzell in the
>
> albany finally agreed to give women the right to have orgasms
>
> but i don't know we've got a lot of single people here tonight and i thought
>
> maybe if any of you
>
> happen to get a swiss girlfriend i've got a few key phrases that might help you
>
> understand her
>
> these are some things i learned for example if she says to you oh this is a
>
> good thing this means
>
> there's a high chance of sexual favors later but if she says shut that is a bad
>
> thing that means
>
> you probably need to spend the night on the sofa but if she says
>
> this is a good thing it means i'm as horny as a whore
>
> it takes a little process that one a little bit because uh you know she might
>
> also say
>
> under no circumstances should you try to lick her
>
> unless unless and she says
>
> in which case you could try to lick her asshole but you might be in for a nasty
>
> surprise
>
> i don't know but i found as a guy it's very hard for men to be in relationships
>
> you know
>
> and i think it's because we just have the wrong perspective because
>
> when a man falls in love with a woman he's thinking i will do anything for her
>
> i will
>
> fight for her i will die for her i will even stop looking at porn for her
>
> you know what i'm talking about so this is a man who's been free of porn for
>
> three maybe four years
>
> but you know for women when a woman falls in love with a man
>
> she doesn't actually fall in love with you she falls in love with the idea of
>
> what she can turn
>
> you into because like take Cyril for example when he got into this relationship
>
> he was like a pit bull
>
> he was like a mean fighting machine and she looked at him and was like
>
> i wonder how i can turn him into a chihuahua
>
> so i can take him to brunch and show him to my friends and go look what i did
>
> with this doggy
>
> walkie isn't he cute with a pink ribbon in his hair he doesn't even shit behind
>
> the curtains anymore
>
> so Cyril you know we need some advanced strategies here you need to and the
>
> person to go to for this
>
> you got to go back in time you got to go back to the most amazing lover there
>
> ever was
>
> joseph starling
>
> look at how russia handled the germans in world war ii they didn't fight them
>
> at the border
>
> they let them come in they let them say yeah sure come in take our territories
>
> we'll just retreat
>
> and that's what you got to do as a guy because here's what you do Cyril
>
> tomorrow morning when you go to work or whatever you're doing wear one sock
>
> and do that the next day and the next day until she says to you hey honey you're
>
> only wearing one
>
> sock and then you go oh thank you thank you i hadn't even noticed oh yeah i'll
>
> wear two socks
>
> and you keep doing that you keep doing that for a while and then eventually she'll
>
> start reminding
>
> you every day and you can be like thank you without you i would never have
>
> noticed my sock problem
>
> and like russia if you do that it'll take a long time
>
> until she gets to anything important like the germans
>
> you'll be able to keep your playstation you'll be able to smell your own farts
>
> you'll even be able to eat your own earwax
>
> and you're great keep that up do we have a little more time yeah
>
> now you see you see one thing for me you know i get very paranoid about things
>
> being taken from me
>
> and that's where this is coming from because when i was a kid when i was about
>
> seven something was
>
> stolen from me that's right i was circumcised now judging by the response to
>
> that comment a
>
> lot of you don't know what circumcision is come and talk to me after i'll show
>
> you
>
> but what began as a very traumatic experience as a child in adult life has
>
> turned into a real
>
> advantage because on those rare occasions where a woman gets in close proximity
>
> with the tip of my
>
> penis she'll be like and i'll be like hey why are you sighing on my penis and
>
> she'll be like
>
> you have no idea how many dirty dicks there are out there oh no
>
> i know i know it's been hard for you i know you've seen a lot of that but i'm
>
> going to fix
>
> that for you tonight now that's when i realized too a lot of my uncut brethren
>
> they're not putting
>
> in enough attention around you so i thought i'd end on a few key tips for you
>
> Cyril to help and
>
> make your lady's life more pleasant you know so the first thing you can do you
>
> know like in your
>
> car you have like that wunderbaum hanging from the mirror just hang it from
>
> your penis
>
> women are very sensitive to smell that will immediately make it more pleasant
>
> for her
>
> women are also very visual so you know like up here above your penis just
>
> just tattoo a pleasant scene like a field of grass with some flowers going
>
> or maybe a tree with a few birds singing you know something to help take her
>
> mind off the
>
> disgusting egg she has but there is actually a much simpler thing you can do is
>
> simply when
>
> she's down there just just bring a box of crackers and once she's there you
>
> kind of
>
> feed her the crackers and that for me is how we're going to end tonight it
>
> guarantees
>
> no one's getting any sex here now you're all with me okay thank you
