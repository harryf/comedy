<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> That's a man who definitely fucks his dog.
>
> No selection process!
>
> Okay, let's move along.
>
> Everybody.
>
> Next comedian.
>
> This guy, he's been living here in Switzerland for the past 18 years, but he's actually from
>
> the UK.
>
> Folks, give it up for Harry, everybody.
>
> Give it up for Harry!
>
> Yes, so my name is Harry.
>
> And I suffer from PPS.
>
> That's perfect penis syndrome.
>
> I'm also the most humble person I know, and it's hard.
>
> It's hard to be this humble when your penis is this perfect.
>
> Sometimes, sometimes I just go to the supermarket, I go to the vegetable section, stare down
>
> some cucumbers, just glare at them, let them know I'm not intimidated.
>
> And it's very distressing to have this condition because I only found out last year that I
>
> have this.
>
> You see, I met a lady, she was a bit of an expert, a dickspert, if you will.
>
> And when she told me, I was just shocked and stunned, I even started to cry because I needed
>
> this information 30 years ago.
>
> I mean, it would have changed everything.
>
> Like if I'd known this at the age of 17, you know, I could have been a pool boy or a snake
>
> charmer.
>
> But instead, instead I went into computers, I've been working with the wrong hardware
>
> for my entire life.
>
> And it made me very depressed.
>
> And so, you know, I did what a real man does under these circumstances.
>
> I go on YouTube and watch animal videos.
>
> But then I found an animal that blew my mind.
>
> This animal is so amazing.
>
> It's a sea creature.
>
> Frankie, can you guess what animal I'm talking about?
>
> >> Turtle.
>
> >> Turtle.
>
> Nice choice, but wrong.
>
> The animal I'm talking about is the Argonaut octopus.
>
> Wow.
>
> This creature is amazing.
>
> So let me explain this a little bit.
>
> Like the female Argonaut is super aggressive.
>
> If a male gets anywhere near it, she's going to eat it.
>
> So the men are terrified of the females.
>
> I think there's some guys here that can relate to this tonight.
>
> So the man developed a unique solution.
>
> I have to explain this in my David Attenborough voice.
>
> When the male of the species spots a female, he detaches his penis, it swims through the
>
> water and homes in on her vagina.
>
> Sorry, not your vagina.
>
> This is real.
>
> This is real.
>
> You can Google that shit.
>
> Don't just put that in layman's terms, there's an octopus out there with a detachable, heat-seeking
>
> dick.
>
> This is incredible.
>
> How are we not teaching kids in school about this?
>
> And it really blew my mind, and it got me thinking, wait a second, how would it be if
>
> human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> Wow, that would be insane, you know?
>
> We probably have, like, dick-related sports, we have, like, dick racing, at the Olympics
>
> you've got the dickathlon, Nike changes its slogan to "Just Dick It!"
>
> And we have a whole range of new dick-related problems, like, what if you lost your dick?
>
> Wow, that would be insane.
>
> You just have to hope on your phone you've got an app called, like, "Find My Penis."
>
> Could you borrow your friend's dick?
>
> That's a crazy thought.
>
> Frankie would be like, "I wasn't cheating, it was Corinne's dick!"
>
> Insane stuff, and you know, when you think about it, and you really think that's true,
>
> like, imagine, it's Monday morning, and Michaela there, the organ harvester, she's at the tram
>
> stop thinking about all the kidneys she's going to harvest today, she's just on her
>
> phone doing the maths, and suddenly, BAM, this dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She's like, "Fuck!"
>
> She hides behind some old ladies, she gets down, she pulls out her dick shield like Captain
>
> America, dicks are just flying all around, hitting the shoe.
>
> She spots a perfect penis on the ground, she's like, "I'll take that."
>
> She jumps in, she arrives at the hospital, runs in through the door, and luckily there's
>
> a sign saying, "Please keep your penis attached during office hours."
>
> That's it.
>
> Thank you, people.
>
> Yes!
>
> Wow!
>
> We really learned a lot about each other.
>
> Okay.
