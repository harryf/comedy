<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> - Comedian number two is half British, half German.
>
> 100% confused.
>
> Okay, what else about him?
>
> I need to prepare this intro better.
>
> So he's also a regular here at Comedy House.
>
> It's his, I think, fourth time here on this stage.
>
> He's super happy to have him here.
>
> Please make a big round of applause, everybody.
>
> Come on.
>
> - So my name is Eric, and I suffer from PPS.
>
> That's perfect penis syndrome.
>
> And I'm also the most humble person I know.
>
> And it's hard, it's really hard to be this humble
>
> when your penis is this perfect.
>
> Sometimes I go to the supermarket,
>
> I go into the vegetable section,
>
> I see some cucumbers, I just stare them down.
>
> Just to let them know I'm not intimidated.
>
> And actually, this has been a big surprise for me
>
> because I only learned that I have PPS last Christmas
>
> because I met this lady, she was a bit of an expert,
>
> expert, if you will.
>
> And when she told me, I was stunned, I was shocked,
>
> because I needed to have this information 30 years ago.
>
> You know, it would have changed everything.
>
> It could have changed my whole life.
>
> I could have just been like a poor boy
>
> or a pizza delivery guy, maybe a snake charmer, I don't know.
>
> Instead, I've spent my whole life working with computers.
>
> I've been working with the wrong hardware.
>
> But something else did happen in these 30 years.
>
> I became a father.
>
> Do we have any parents here tonight?
>
> Give me a round of applause.
>
> And a big respect to that because, you know,
>
> I really appreciate that you have come out here.
>
> Hiring a babysitter in this city
>
> costs as much as these management consultants.
>
> So I actually really appreciate your effort tonight.
>
> No, it's true.
>
> So I'm a single dad.
>
> I have two teenage kids, and they live with me.
>
> And living with teenagers is like living
>
> in a student bedroom with a flat chair.
>
> 'Cause there's never any milk.
>
> It's always a mess, and I get to pay for everything.
>
> It's the shittest flat chair ever.
>
> Although, actually, I can imagine one thing even worse
>
> might be being in a flat chair with these umbrellas.
>
> Can you imagine, when it comes to cleaning up?
>
> Hmm, we need a strategy for vacuum cleaning.
>
> I'll explain the strategy, and you do it,
>
> and she'll be like, "No, no, I'm not insured
>
> "for any vacuum cleaning.
>
> "That would be that flat chair."
>
> No, but I live with these teenagers, and yeah.
>
> And it's been tough, but there is some good news.
>
> There is some amazing news, because tonight,
>
> I get to get some revenge, because they're actually
>
> both there in the back, my two teenage kids.
>
> Give them a little wave.
>
> Just to give you some context, two nights ago,
>
> they basically destroyed our flat.
>
> There was complete mess.
>
> I got back home, pizza boxes.
>
> It was just a disaster.
>
> So tonight, we're gonna have a little discussion,
>
> aren't we, guys?
>
> So I have a, first I've got a teenage boy.
>
> He's 14, and he's having a bit of a tough time right now
>
> with the ladies, because he's actually been rejected
>
> over 50 times by the same girl.
>
> I'm glad you're keeping up the family tradition, then.
>
> But I do hope you don't get PPS.
>
> And actually, recently, we had a very awkward situation,
>
> because I caught him looking at porn.
>
> Wow, that's an awkward situation, definitely.
>
> Luckily, luckily, I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> I could point him at all the best categories.
>
> It's important to be a responsible parent.
>
> And actually, another thing about my son
>
> is he plays a lot of GTA, Grand Theft Auto.
>
> Now, some of you who know this game may be thinking,
>
> "You can't let him play that.
>
> "That's that game where he gets to beat up hookers
>
> "and run over old ladies."
>
> But you know, I think, I think, actually,
>
> GTA is teaching him some important life skills.
>
> For example, he's learned to sit in a chair for eight hours
>
> without moving, eating, or going to the toilet.
>
> Which is clearly great preparation for the future
>
> of his life.
>
> And also, he plays online.
>
> Thank you, Andrea, for saying that.
>
> The rest, I've lost them.
>
> So I was going to say anything.
>
> So he plays online, and one thing I really appreciate
>
> as I've come originally from England,
>
> is it's radically improved his English.
>
> His English has got a lot better.
>
> He's learned some key phrases like,
>
> "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> "I will piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> It's great.
>
> It makes me feel like we're making good progress.
>
> But, you know, we've done, like, the teenage son.
>
> Of course, my other kid is the teenage girl.
>
> And as a single dad, with a teenage daughter,
>
> I'm constantly being confronted with situations
>
> that I'm wholly unprepared for.
>
> I can feel the tension.
>
> That's good.
>
> Because I remember this time,
>
> this happened a little while ago.
>
> I came back from work, I went into the bathroom,
>
> and oh my God, it looked like a crime scene.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror.
>
> Drops of blood in the sink, more blood on the floor,
>
> and that toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around,
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> And at that moment, my daughter turned up and said,
>
> "Hey Dad, I got my period!"
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> yeah, now I have to do that, she's a teenager,
>
> she just smeared around and shit,
>
> that's unfortunately my job.
>
> After that, I said to her, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> She said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now obviously as a man, this is a job
>
> I have zero qualifications for.
>
> So I said, "Hey, this can't be so hard."
>
> So I went over to Migo, I took a look around,
>
> and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are useless when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because they have names like OB Pro,
>
> and what is that, like professional women
>
> that bleed for a living?
>
> I think I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance, like what is this,
>
> like glow-in-the-dark tampons, or what is that, I don't know.
>
> And what I like the most is Always Infinity.
>
> For her vagina, it's an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven, wow.
>
> This is fantastic.
>
> 'Cause it's right about 10 o'clock, it's so sleek,
>
> and she's Always Home by Eleven, it's amazing.
>
> And for me, as a father, I have to say,
>
> it was a very proud moment.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> I had a better response to that than I expected.
>
> Thank you very much.
>
> All right, well let me just wrap it up by saying this,
>
> is that these days, actually, my daughter
>
> is currently thinking about becoming,
>
> oh, thank you, this guy really gets it.
>
> I appreciate it, he must be a dad or something.
>
> And no, these days, my daughter's actually thinking
>
> about becoming a massage therapist.
>
> So this story, at least, does have a happy ending.
>
> Give it up to these two guys.
>
> I love them, they're lovely people.
>
> In this case, thank you.
>
> Thank you, Donuts! Thank you, McDonough!
