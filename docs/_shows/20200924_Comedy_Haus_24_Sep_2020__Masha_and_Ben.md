<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Comedian #2 is half British, half German.
>
> 100% confused.
>
> What else about him?
>
> I need to prepare this intro better.
>
> He's also a regular here at Comedy House.
>
> It's his 4th time here on this stage, so super happy to have him here.
>
> Please, make a big round of applause, everybody!
>
> Come on!
>
> So my name is Harry.
>
> And I suffer from PPS.
>
> That's Perfect Penis Syndrome.
>
> And I'm also the most humble person I know.
>
> And it's hard, it's really hard to be this humble.
>
> When your penis is this perfect.
>
> Sometimes I go to the supermarket.
>
> I go into the vegetable section.
>
> I see some cucumbers, I just stare them down.
>
> Just to let them know I'm not intimidated.
>
> And actually, this has been a big surprise for me.
>
> Because I only learned that I have PPS last Christmas.
>
> Because I met this lady.
>
> She was a bit of an expert.
>
> Dixpert, if you will.
>
> And when she told me, I was stunned.
>
> I was shocked.
>
> Because I needed to have this information 30 years ago.
>
> You know, it would have changed everything.
>
> It could have changed my whole life.
>
> I could have just been like a poor boy.
>
> Or a pizza delivery guy.
>
> Maybe a snake charmer.
>
> Instead, I've spent my whole life working with computers.
>
> I've been working with the wrong hardware.
>
> But something else did happen in these 30 years.
>
> I became a father.
>
> Do we have any parents here tonight?
>
> Give me a round of applause.
>
> A big respect to that.
>
> Because, you know, I really appreciate that you have come out here.
>
> Hiring a babysitter in this city costs as much as these management consultants.
>
> So, I actually really appreciate the effort tonight.
>
> No, it's true.
>
> So, I'm a single dad.
>
> And I have two teenage kids.
>
> And they live with me.
>
> And living with teenagers is like living in a student baby as a flight chair.
>
> Because there's never any milk.
>
> It's always a mess.
>
> And I get to pay for everything.
>
> It's the shittest flat chair ever.
>
> Well, actually, I can imagine one thing even worse might be being a flat chair
>
> with these embryos.
>
> Can you imagine when it comes to cleaning up?
>
> Hmm, we need a strategy for vacuum cleaning.
>
> Like, I'll explain the strategy and you do it.
>
> And she'll be like, "No, no, I'm not insured for any vacuum cleaning."
>
> That would be that flat chair.
>
> No.
>
> But I live with these teenagers.
>
> And, yeah.
>
> And it's been tough.
>
> But there is some good news.
>
> There is some amazing news.
>
> Because tonight, I get to get some revenge.
>
> Because they're actually both there in the back.
>
> My two teenage kids.
>
> Give it a little wave.
>
> I'll just give you some context.
>
> Two nights ago, they basically just came out of the bathroom.
>
> And they were just sitting there.
>
> And I was like, "What's going on?"
>
> And they were like, "What's going on?"
>
