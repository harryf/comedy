> I have to say she failed to mention Turkish people dancing.
>
> We'd get arrested if we didn't.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we only have one last comedian left in our first half.
>
> I know guys.
>
> Awww.
>
> Do it harder!
>
> Awww.
>
> Don't worry guys, we've got more comedy in the second half.
>
> But for now, the stage is to the last comedian.
>
> This guy is originally from the UK, but he's been living here for such a long
>
> time.
>
> I love this comedian.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Harry Fox everybody!
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelled F-U-C-K-S-R-E-P.
>
> F-U-C-K-S-R-E-P.
>
> With English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group
>
> of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Howler and Whatler.
>
> But I am a very proud father, because I know a lot of our parents, and I'm a
>
> single dad.
>
> Both my kids have only a teenager's head.
>
> And I was there in the room where they were born.
>
> And I was behind my partner, propping her up, hugging her down, and now I can
>
> give some
>
> advice to all the young men here, before you become fathers.
>
> At a certain point, the nurse will come to you and say, "You can see the head!"
>
> "Why don't you come and look?"
>
> The correct answer is, "No!"
>
> Because if you go around there, you are going to see things that are going to
>
> disturb your
>
> life.
>
> For example, the bit that you love the most about your partner, the most
>
> perfect thing
>
> on her, just got turned into the gutter tunnel.
>
> And like the gutter tunnel, in the future, it's going to take you a long time
>
> to get
>
> in there.
>
> You're still not going to be allowed to use the second tunnel.
>
> And once you're inside, you're probably going to fall asleep.
>
> It's not good stuff, so that's why you don't do that.
>
> In fact, it does kind of upset me that society has so many misplaced ideas
>
> about babies and
>
> children.
>
> For example, have you ever seen a group of young women, when one of them has
>
> just had
>
> her first child, and they're all gathered around her, "Oh, so cute, so sweet, a
>
> baby!
>
> I just love the way babies smell!"
>
> I hate to break this to you, but it's not the smell of a baby.
>
> It's the smell of something that just spent nine months in your friend's vagina.
>
> The correct thing you should be saying is, "Oh, so cute, so sweet, I just love
>
> the smell
>
> of your pussy!"
>
> This is how society gets it wrong.
>
> You know, for me, parenting is hard, especially as a single parent, and one of
>
> the big problems
>
> nowadays is dealing with technology, like parenting and technology brings up a
>
> lot of
>
> new problems that have never been seen before.
>
> For example, recently, I caught my 13-year-old son looking at porn.
>
> Luckily, I could point him at the best categories.
>
> I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> We came to an agreement in the end.
>
> We said, "Son, we're going to sort this on categories.
>
> Right now, you get to look at penis and vagina, you get to look at blowjobs,
>
> you get to look
>
> at masturbation.
>
> For his birthday, he's getting lesbians, because you've got to keep some fantasies
>
> about things
>
> you will never see.
>
> And then, you know, when he gets older, like at 16, you know, maybe he gets
>
> into coup shots,
>
> 18, we're talking anal, but we're saving strangling, deep throat, this kind of
>
> stuff to when he
>
> gets dumped by his first girlfriend.
>
> You've got to be a responsible parent.
>
> Another problem with this is, you know, he plays Fortnite.
>
> Have you heard of Fortnite?
>
> Just in case you haven't heard of it, it's an online shooter, you play it
>
> against other
>
> people online.
>
> Recently, the makers of Fortnite said they had 125 million players online at
>
> the same
>
> time.
>
> That is so many kids, that they're saying it's ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me as a father, I actually think it's teaching my son some important
>
> life skills.
>
> Because, for example, he's learned to sit still in a chair for eight hours
>
> without moving
>
> onto the toilet, or eating, which is clearly a great experience for the future
>
> of his life.
>
> And his English, his English has gone very good.
>
> He's learned some key phrases like, "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> Or, "I will piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> Again, I'm very proud, very proud.
>
> If you have a little bit longer, you know what's coming up.
>
> Because I also have a daughter, and you're already, the anticipation is
>
> wonderful.
>
> Because it's really like, for me as a man, bringing up a daughter is really
>
> tough.
>
> Because I'm really there confronted with situations I'm wholly unprepared for.
>
> Because recently I came back from work, I went into the bathroom, and oh my god,
>
> it
>
> looked like a crime scene.
>
> There was a bloody hand print on the mirror, drops of blood in the sink, more
>
> on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around, and I realized the screaming
>
> was coming
>
> from me.
>
> But at that moment, at that moment, my daughter showed up, and she said, "Dad,
>
> guess what?
>
> I got my period!"
>
> So after cleaning up my daughter's menstrual block, I was like, "Hey, can I get
>
> you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now obviously as a man, I have zero qualifications for this, but I thought, "It
>
> can't be so hard."
>
> So I went over to Miglo, and I took a look around.
>
> And what I learned is that tampon product names are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it
>
> comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because for example, you have like, OB PRO, what are we talking, for like,
>
> professional
>
> women that bleed for a living?
>
> Yeah, that's strange, okay.
>
> And then we have TAMPAX RADIANCE, like what, glow-in-the-dark tampons, when the
>
> lights
>
> are off to scare women?
>
> The one I like the most, though, is ALWAYS INFINITY.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from ALWAYS, it's called ALWAYS HOME BY
>
> ELEVEN.
>
> It is amazing, because right about ten o'clock it starts to leak, and she is ALWAYS,
>
> ALWAYS
>
> HOME BY ELEVEN.
>
> And for me, for me again, I was very proud as a father, because as a father, it's
>
> not
>
> every day you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Oh my goodness!
>
> Now, was that a fantastic half of comedy, or what?
>
> Okay, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna take a very quick break, okay?
