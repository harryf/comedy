> Okay, I have to say, she failed to mention Turkish people dancing.
>
> We get arrested if we do that. It's very sad.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we only have one last comedian left in our first half.
>
> I know, guys. Awww.
>
> Do it harder!
>
> Don't worry, guys. We've got more comedy in the second half.
>
> But for now, the stage is to the last comedian.
>
> This guy is originally from the UK, but he's been living here for such a long
>
> time.
>
> I love this comedian. Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Harry Fuchs,
>
> everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> What was it?
>
> It's a German name spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> With English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Bucks.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them howler and whatler.
>
> But I am a very proud father.
>
> Because I know a lot about parenting.
>
> I'm a single dad. Both my kids are young. They're teenagers now.
>
> And I was there. I was there in the room where they were born.
>
> And I was behind my partner, propping her up, calming her down.
>
> And now I can give some advice to all the young men here.
>
> Before you become fathers, at a certain point, the nurse will come to you and
>
> say,
>
> "You can see the head. Why don't you come and look?"
>
> The correct answer is NO!
>
> Because if you go around there, if you go around there, you are going to see
>
> things that are going to disturb you.
>
> For example, the bit that you love the most about your partner, the most
>
> perfect thing on her,
>
> just got turned into the Gotthard Tunnel.
>
> And like the Gotthard Tunnel, in the future it's going to take you a long time
>
> to get in there.
>
> You're still not going to be allowed to use the second tunnel.
>
> And once you're inside, you're probably going to fall asleep.
>
> It's not good stuff. So that's why you don't do that.
>
> In fact, it does kind of upset me.
>
> That society has so many misplaced ideas about babies and children.
>
> For example, have you ever seen a group of young women, when one of them has
>
> just had her first child,
>
> and they all gather around and go, "Oh, so cute, so sweet, a baby!"
>
> "I just love the way babies smell!"
>
> I hate to break this to you.
>
> That is not the smell of a baby.
>
> That is the smell of something that just spent nine months in your frame.
>
> Nine months in your friend's vagina.
>
> The correct thing you should be saying is, "Oh, so cute, so sweet!"
>
> "I just love the smell of your pussy."
>
> This is how society gets it wrong.
>
> But, you know, for me, parenting is hard, especially as a single parent.
>
> And one of the big problems nowadays is dealing with technology.
>
> Parenting and technology brings up a lot of new problems that have never been
>
> seen before.
>
> For example, recently, I caught my 13-year-old son looking at porn.
>
> Hell yeah!
>
> Luckily, I could point him at the best categories.
>
> I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> We came to an agreement in the end.
>
> We said, "Right, son, we're going to sort this on categories."
>
> Right now, you get to look at penis and vagina.
>
> You get to look at blowjobs.
>
> You get to look at masturbation.
>
> For his birthday, he's getting lesbians.
>
> You've got to keep some fantasies about things you will never see.
>
> And then, you know, when he gets older, like at 16, maybe he gets into coup
>
> shots.
>
> At 18, we're talking anal.
>
> But we're saving strangling, deep throat, this kind of stuff, to when he gets
>
> dumped by his first girlfriend.
>
> You've got to be a responsible parent.
>
> And another problem with this is, you know, he plays Fortnite.
>
> Have you heard of Fortnite?
>
> Just in case you haven't heard of it, it's an online shooter.
>
> You play it against other people online.
>
> Recently, the makers of Fortnite said they had 125 million players online at
>
> the same time.
>
> That is so many kids.
>
> But they're saying it's ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me, as a father, I actually think it's teaching my son some important
>
> life skills.
>
> Because, for example, he's learned to sit still in a chair for eight hours
>
> without moving, going to the toilet, or eating.
>
> Which is clearly a great experience for future office life.
>
> And his English.
>
> His English has gone very good.
>
> He's learned some key phrases like...
>
> "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> "And I will piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> Again, I'm very proud.
>
> You have a little bit longer.
>
> Okay, you know what's coming up.
>
> Because I also have a daughter.
>
> You're already...
>
> The anticipation is going through you.
>
> Because it's really like...
>
> For me, it's a memory that the daughter is really tough.
>
> You know, because I'm really there confronted with situations I'm wholly unprepared
>
> for.
>
> Because, like, recently I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom.
>
> And, oh my God, it looked like a crime scene.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror.
>
> Drops of blood in the sink.
>
> More on the floor.
>
> And the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming.
>
> And I looked around.
>
> And I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, at that moment, my daughter showed up.
>
> And she said, "Dad, guess what? I got my period!"
>
> So, after cleaning up my daughter's menstrual bed...
>
> I was like, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, obviously, as a man, I have zero qualifications.
>
> But I thought, "Can't be so hard."
>
> So, I went over to Miglo.
>
> And I took a look around.
>
> And what I learned is that tampon product names are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because, for example, you have, like, OB Pro.
>
> What are we talking?
>
> For, like, professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> Yeah, that's strange. Okay.
>
> And then we have Tampax Radiance.
>
> Like, what, glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> When the lights are off, just to get it in there?
>
> The one I like the most, though, is Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It is amazing.
>
> Because right about 10 o'clock, it starts to leak.
>
> And she is always, always home by 11:00.
>
> And for me, for me again, I was very proud as a father.
>
> Because as a father, it's not every day you get to choose what your daughter crams
>
> in her vagina.
>
> Thank you very much.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Give it up for Harry Flux, everybody!
>
> Oh my goodness!
>
> Now, was that a fantastic half of comedy or what?
>
> Okay, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna take a very quick break, okay?
