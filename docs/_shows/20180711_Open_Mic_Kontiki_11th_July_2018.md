> So, it's really a special night for me tonight, because my daughter's here, and
>
> she's with
>
> her boyfriend.
>
> And now they're curious about how it feels to have a shit on your back.
>
> I think it's somewhere around here is where I realize that my life is a
>
> complete failure.
>
> In fact, my name is not Harry Fuchs, it's Harry Fuchs, it's a German name.
>
> Unfortunately, all English speakers seem to think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> When we have a family reunion, just for your information, we are a group of fucks.
>
> We are not a group of fuckers.
>
> Yeah, so, but I mean, honestly, the name Harry Fuchs sets a high level of
>
> expectation, you'd
>
> be thinking that I'm some kind of porn star, probably pre-internet, a guy that
>
> had some
>
> DVDs like "Harry Fuchs Dallas", "Harry Fuchs Europe", "Harry Fuchs Your Mum".
>
> To be fair, to be fair, the honest truth is, there's just been way too little
>
> fucking in
>
> my life.
>
> It's just enough for my genes to pass to another generation and that's about it.
>
> In fact, recently, unfortunately, I was dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend.
>
> This is serious now, please, you can stop laughing.
>
> After four and a half years, it was a very traumatic experience, but actually,
>
> it's now
>
> made me an expert on all Swiss women and one of the things that you find
>
> difficult when
>
> you have a Swiss girlfriend is they don't communicate very well, they don't
>
> express
>
> themselves very well, especially towards women.
>
> And the surprising reason for this is actually, Switzerland has a very poor
>
> track record on
>
> women's rights.
>
> Not a lot of people know this, but in 1991, just not long ago, you know, it was
>
> the last
>
> canton of Appenzell-Innerhorden finally agreed to give women the right to have
>
> orgasms.
>
> So Swiss women have quite a lot of catching up to do compared to, say, Dutch,
>
> German or
>
> American women when it comes to the fine arts of nagging and making their men
>
> feel miserable.
>
> But I thought to help any guys who end up in a similar situation to me, there'd
>
> be a
>
> few key phrases that will help you understand your lady better.
>
> So for example, if you hear her say, "Oh, Schätzli," this is a good thing.
>
> This is a good thing.
>
> It means that later on, there is a high probability of receiving sexual favors.
>
> But if she says, "Schatz," this is not good.
>
> This means you should probably spend the night on the sofa.
>
> But if she says to you, "Horregeil," this is a good thing.
>
> This means, "I'm as horny as a whore."
>
> But if she says, "Leck mich doch am Arsch," under no circumstances should you
>
> try to lick
>
> her asshole, unless if she follows with, "Das ist ein Schiestreck," in which
>
> case you could
>
> think about licking her asshole, but you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> So international relations is hard.
>
> I know that because I've been here 17 years, originally came from the UK, and
>
> actually
>
> I'm at the point now where I'm just about to start applying for my Swiss
>
> passport.
>
> And when I get that passport, actually, I'm going to be voting SVP because it's
>
> time to
>
> do something about all the immigrants, all the English-speaking immigrants.
>
> I mean the Americans, the English, the Australians, those freaking Canadians,
>
> the Kiwis, because
>
> let's look at these guys.
>
> Look what they've been doing.
>
> They voted for Brexit, they voted for Trump, and then they go, "Oh my God, we've
>
> fucked
>
> up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> But then you've got to ask, what are these guys actually bringing to the party
>
> here in
>
> Switzerland because when the Indians or the Vietnamese came here, they brought
>
> great cuisine.
>
> Or the Romanians or the Brazilians, they brought sexual relief.
>
> You've just got to watch who laughs too loud on that one.
>
> But these English speakers, they don't even bother to learn the language.
>
> They're going out in the evenings listening to English stand-up comedy.
>
> It's really not okay.
>
> So for me, my mission now is to stop this country getting stolen.
>
> And this actually goes back to my childhood when I was just seven years old,
>
> something
>
> was taken from me.
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> Now, judging by the giggles here, most of you don't understand circumcision.
>
> Come talk to me afterwards, I'll show you.
>
> But the reason why I was circumcised was not actually for religious reasons, it
>
> was a medical
>
> emergency.
>
> And the only way they could save my life was by cutting off my foreskin.
>
> But what began as a very traumatic childhood experience, actually in adult life,
>
> turned
>
> to a real advantage because on those rare occasions where a woman would come
>
> into close
>
> proximity with the tip of my penis, she would invariably sigh like, "Ahh."
>
> And I'd be like, "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'd be like, "You have no idea what a relief it is because there are so
>
> many dirty
>
> dicks out there."
>
> Yeah, she gets it.
>
> She gets it.
>
> I know, I feel it.
>
> Because what I learned is that actually amongst my uncut brethren, a lot of you
>
> guys are not
>
> putting enough attention into this area.
>
> And so what I thought, I'd wrap up with just a few tips to help you make your
>
> woman's life
>
> more pleasant.
>
> So the first thing you can do, of course, is air freshener.
>
> You know like in your car, hanging from the rear view mirror, you have that
>
> Wonder Balm?
>
> Just hang it from your penis.
>
> That will help immediately.
>
> Women are very sensitive to smell.
>
> Women are also very visual.
>
> So what you can do is right here up above your penis is just tattoo a pleasant
>
> scene
>
> like a field of nice green grass with some flowers growing in it or maybe a
>
> tree with
>
> a few birds singing in it.
>
> Something to take her mind off the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> But probably the simplest thing you can do is just simply bring a box of
>
> crackers with
>
> you.
>
> And when she's down there, just kind of feed her the crackers because cheese
>
> goes really
>
> well with crackers.
>
> What I didn't tell you, that's my last joke, but my mission is always to end
>
> the night
>
> when no one's getting any sex.
>
> And I think with that joke, it's now guaranteed, especially these two.
>
> Thanks a lot, you've been great.
