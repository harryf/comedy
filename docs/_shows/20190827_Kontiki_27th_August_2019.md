<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Anybody can get on stage, okay? Like Max. Do you think you can do comedy?
>
> I liked your answer before. I thought it was funny.
>
> So if anybody amongst you guys is like, "You know what? I think I can do comedy,
>
> Matt."
>
> Just come to me after the show or go online on our page and sign up to do a
>
> spot in.
>
> You can totally be on stage next Tuesday.
>
> But for now, let's move along with our next comedian of the night.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, he's done an open mic a bunch of times before.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When we're in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> What's he though?
>
> We're coming to that.
>
> And, you know, it's hard with this name because, you know, when we have a
>
> family get-together,
>
> we get really upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> And I have to call them Albert and Walter.
>
> And, you know, but actually a real problem with this name is I get a lot of
>
> stupid comments like this comment earlier.
>
> Like recently this American tourist came up to me and he's like,
>
> "Yo, what's up, man? Harry Fox. Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> I'm like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Yeah, Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> So I thought, I'm smart. Smarter than him, at least.
>
> Let me try him off with some adverbs, you know.
>
> Harry Fox, uh, hopefully.
>
> Harry Fox, occasionally.
>
> Harry Fox, enthusiastically.
>
> And that was it for this man. He just melted down.
>
> But no, actually the real problem with this name is it just sets a very high
>
> level of expectation.
>
> And I've only really done about this much, but I feel like, well, it's more
>
> like that much.
>
> And actually if I can share something, you know, I'm in a bit of a tricky spot.
>
> Because, you know, for 20 years I was in a long-term relationship with one
>
> woman or another.
>
> But since about a year...
>
> Why is that so funny?
>
> Jesus, fuck all of you people.
>
> That's horrible.
>
> I'm sharing deep, intimate parts of my life here.
>
> And I've been single for about a year. I don't really know why.
>
> It's been tough to find someone.
>
> But 20 years ago, we didn't have Tinder.
>
> And so I thought, okay, I'll give Tinder a try.
>
> Maybe that's the answer.
>
> How wrong I was.
>
> Because for you guys, for you guys, you're mostly under 30.
>
> Tinder for you guys is an amazing place.
>
> You get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies.
>
> And potential erotic encounters.
>
> And the dream, the dream that your prince, your ideal man, might somehow be in
>
> there.
>
> But for me, Tinder over 40 is a dark place.
>
> I get to swipe my way through broken marriages.
>
> Drug and alcohol problems.
>
> Psychiatrists.
>
> Fucking hard, man.
>
> And you know, the worst is when you see the tattoos and say, "No regrets!"
>
> Philippa, do you have tattoos back there?
>
> You do?
>
> You do. What kind of tattoos do you have, Philippa?
>
> Quite different ones.
>
> Yeah, you know, dropped in Congress in a different city.
>
> And in the United States, I would never be able to get them.
>
> So you've been collecting tattoos in every city around the world.
>
> Is it all guys' names?
>
> Okay, we don't need to get upset.
>
> "Oh, I'm a bad guy."
>
> Because, you know, and the thing is actually, if we go back to Tinder for a
>
> second,
>
> the hard part is actually more that, you know, when you see older women,
>
> they're oddly specific in their profiles on Tinder
>
> about what they don't want from their next relationship.
>
> It's kind of like this is what their guide last did to them.
>
> You know, it's like, "Swipe left if you hate my children.
>
> Swipe left if you're planning to run off with my sister.
>
> Swipe left if you fantasize about adult diapers."
>
> Yeah, I know, it's hard. It's hard.
>
> And I have to ask women, what is it, ladies here,
>
> what is it that happens to you in the next 10 to 15 years
>
> that leads to your life being destroyed?
>
> Men.
>
> Exactly, it's that prince you found on Tinder.
>
> But you know, it's actually not the scariest thing about Tinder.
>
> To me, personally, the scariest thing on Tinder
>
> is the sight of a 50-year-old woman making a duck face.
>
> Because, honestly, how the fuck do you get to 50
>
> thinking that a duck face is okay?
>
> It's like the only time a duck face is ever okay
>
> is if both your parents are ducks.
>
> Give it up, Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Yes, he does.
