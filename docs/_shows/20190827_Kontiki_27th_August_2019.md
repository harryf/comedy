> Anybody can get on stage, okay?
>
> Like Max, do you think you could do comedy?
>
> I liked your answer before, I thought it was funny.
>
> So if anybody amongst you guys is like,
>
> you know what, I think I could do comedy, man.
>
> Just come to me after the show,
>
> or go online on our page and sign up to do a spot,
>
> and you can totally be on stage next Tuesday.
>
> But for now, let's move along with our next comedian of the night,
>
> ladies and gentlemen.
>
> He's done an open mic a bunch of times before.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> Don't say no.
>
> We're coming to that.
>
> Stay calm.
>
> And, you know, it's hard with this name,
>
> because, you know, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get really upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> And I had to call them Halbert and Walter.
>
> And, you know, I don't know.
>
> But actually, a real problem with this name is
>
> it's like a lot of stupid comments, like this comment earlier.
>
> You know, like recently, this American tourist came up to me.
>
> He's like, yo, what's up, man?
>
> Harry Fuchs.
>
> Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> I'm like, what?
>
> He's like, yeah, Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> So I thought, I'm smart.
>
> Smarter than him, at least.
>
> Let me throw him off with some adverts, you know.
>
> Harry Fuchs.
>
> Now, hopefully, Harry Fuchs occasionally.
>
> Harry Fuchs enthusiastically.
>
> And that was it for this man.
>
> He just melted down.
>
> But no, actually, the real problem with this name
>
> is it just sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And I've only really done about this much for a film.
>
> Well, I think, like, more like that much.
>
> And actually, if I can share something, you know,
>
> I'm in a bit of a tricky spot.
>
> Because, you know, for 20 years,
>
> I was in a long-term relationship with one woman or another.
>
> But since about a year...
>
> Why is that so funny?
>
> Jesus, fuck all of you people.
>
> That's horrible.
>
> Like, I'm sharing, like, deep, intimate parts of my life here.
>
> And, but, you know, and I've been single for about a year.
>
> I don't really know why.
>
> It's been tough to find someone.
>
> And, you know, but 20 years ago,
>
> we didn't have...
>
> We didn't have Tinder.
>
> And so I thought, okay, I'll give Tinder a try.
>
> Maybe that's the answer.
>
> How wrong I was.
>
> Because for you guys, for you guys,
>
> you're mostly under 30.
>
> Tinder for you guys is an amazing place.
>
> Because you get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies
>
> and potential erotic encounters.
>
> And the dream, the dream that your prince,
>
> your ideal man might somehow be in there.
>
> But for me,
>
> for me, Tinder over 40 is a dark place.
>
> I get to swipe my way through broken marriages,
>
> drug and alcohol problems,
>
> psychiatrists.
>
> Fucking hard, man.
>
> And, you know,
>
> the worst is when you see the tattoos and say,
>
> no regrets.
>
> Philippa, do you have tattoos?
>
> Back there?
>
> On your...
>
> You do?
>
> What kind of tattoos do you have, Philippa?
>
> Quite different ones.
>
> Yeah, you know, dropped in Congress in different cities.
>
> And it just couldn't stay simple.
>
> Never be able to do that.
>
> So you've been collecting tattoos in every city around the world?
>
> Yeah.
>
> Is it all guys' names?
>
> Okay.
>
> We don't need to go.
>
> Oh, I'm a bad guy.
>
> Because, you know...
>
> And the thing is, actually,
>
> but if we go back to Tinder for a second,
>
> the hard part is actually...
>
> more that, you know,
>
> when you see older women,
>
> they're oddly specific in their profiles on Tinder
>
> about what they don't want from their next relationship.
>
> It's kind of like this is what their guy last did to them.
>
> You know, it's like,
>
> swipe left if you hate my children.
>
> Swipe left if you're planning to run off with my sister.
>
> Swipe left if you fantasize about adult diapers.
>
> Yeah, I know, it's hard.
>
> It's hard.
>
> And I have to ask,
>
> women, what is it?
>
> Ladies here,
>
> what is it that happens to you in the next 10 to 15 years
>
> that leads to your life being destroyed?
>
> Men.
>
> Men.
>
> Exactly.
>
> It's that prince you found on Tinder.
>
> But, you know,
>
> it's actually not the scariest thing about Tinder.
>
> To me, personally,
>
> the scariest thing on Tinder
>
> is the sight of a 50-year-old woman
>
> making a...
>
> duck face.
>
> Because, honestly,
>
> how the fuck do you get to 50
>
> thinking that a duck face is okay?
>
> It's like the only time
>
> a duck face is ever okay
>
> is if both your parents are ducks.
>
> Give it up, Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Yes, he does.
