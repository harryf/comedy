> Give it up for Chris Carwell once again, everybody!
>
> Virtuontos. Uh, okay.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's about time we bring up the last act of
>
> tonight.
>
> He's the sexiest comedian here in Zurich.
>
> I love him. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for our last comedian of tonight!
>
> Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room with a lot of English speakers, you will think my name is Harry
>
> Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Because in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Howler and Whatler.
>
> You know, I didn't want them to get bullied at school.
>
> But, uh, you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is
>
> it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And I've only really done about this much, if I can.
>
> In fact, honestly, I'm going to share something with you.
>
> It has actually been quite a long time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Yeah, I'm going to realize I'm coming to the Zurich Infomaniacs Anonymous.
>
> So maybe then, to help you understand my condition,
>
> how it is for someone when they haven't had sex in a long time,
>
> it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> It's, uh, you know, you could be walking down the street
>
> and you see a couple of dogs,
>
> and they're sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into micro, you see an action on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Boom. It's like you're in a different dimension.
>
> You're getting hot, it's getting steamy.
>
> You've forgotten you're in micro, there's everyone watching you.
>
> And then you hear this, "Junge, man, schämen Sie sich nicht!"
>
> And you look, and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, "She's nice."
>
> Yeah, that's how it is.
>
> But, you know, I've been having it pretty hard recently
>
> because, you know, the last 20 years of my life
>
> I've been in one long-term relationship or another.
>
> But since about a year now I've been back in the dating pool,
>
> which obviously completely sucks.
>
> But, you know, 20 years ago we didn't have Tinder.
>
> So I thought, "Okay, I'll give Tinder a try, maybe that's the answer."
>
> How wrong I was.
>
> Because for you guys, you guys, you're all young, you know.
>
> Tinder for under-30-year-olds is an amazing place.
>
> Because you get to swipe through hot, sexy bodies
>
> and potential erotic encounters
>
> and the dream that your prince might be in here.
>
> But for me, for me, Tinder over 40 is a very dark place.
>
> No, seriously, because I have to swipe my way through broken marriages,
>
> broken alcohol problems, faded tattoos saying, "No regrets."
>
> I regret having seen that.
>
> But, you know, and the funny thing is, is all the women on Tinder,
>
> when it comes to their Tinder profile, they're oddly specific, you know.
>
> Because they put stuff in there that seems to be about what they don't want
>
> in their next relationship, like, "Swipe left if you hate children."
>
> "Swipe left if you're planning to run off with my sister."
>
> "Swipe left if you fantasize about adult diapers."
>
> And it's really kind of weird.
>
> And it makes me wonder, you know, ladies, what is it that happens to you
>
> in the next 10 to 15 years that your life ends up ruined?
>
> Could it be that prince that you found on Tinder one time?
>
> You know, it's tough.
>
> But, you know, we could have gone for an "ah" at this point.
>
> But, you know, for me the thing is, is like, you know,
>
> sometimes I think about this and I think, you know, maybe the real problem
>
> is when I get on Tinder and I see a 50-year-old woman making a duck face.
>
> Because how do you get to 50 years thinking that a duck face is okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is okay is when both your parents are ducks.
>
> Ducks typically only live about 10 years.
>
> The universe had no idea of a 50-year-old duck face.
>
> It just shouldn't be happening.
>
> So I was on Tinder and then this woman, one time this woman, she was about 52,
>
> I think, she sent me this message.
>
> With those cute blue eyes, how is it you're running around free?
>
> Now, aside from the fact that that is probably the worst chat up line ever,
>
> just imagine me as a man if I said that to any woman.
>
> You shouldn't be running around free.
>
> You should be tied up in my dungeon.
>
> It's really kind of a weird thing to want to say to someone.
>
> What it made me realize is actually the real problem here is that all the women,
>
> they don't really know--many of you don't know how to chat up men because,
>
> you know, you have zero game.
>
> Because all the time, men were chasing you.
>
> Men got all the practice.
>
> And, you know, to be honest, things are getting a bit saggy now.
>
> The men aren't showing so much interest.
>
> And for me, I actually--I feel really kind of sorry for them because
>
> recently I was reading that as women get older, their sex drive actually
>
> increases.
>
> So what we're saying is that they have zero game, they're super horny,
>
> and no one really wants to fuck them.
>
> Now, I know at this point--
>
> Who the fuck is this guy?
>
> Can I solve this for you?
>
> I think I have a solution.
>
> We need to find another group that has zero game, is super horny,
>
> and that no one wants to fuck.
>
> Teenage boys.
>
> We need an app for all the women.
>
> It's called Teendar.
>
> Yeah, but, I mean, honestly--thank you, thank you.
>
> I fear the guys are with that.
>
> The women are like, "Fuck this guy."
>
> So, you know, honestly--but I'm not saying I'm getting a lot of sex.
>
> We've already established that.
>
> Part of the reason for that is that I'm a single dad.
>
> I have two teenage kids, and they both live with me,
>
> so absolutely no one wants to fuck me.
>
> But, you know, I thought I'd tell you maybe a little bit
>
> of what it's like to be a single dad,
>
> because I'm constantly being confronted with situations
>
> that I am wholly unprepared for.
>
> For example, recently, I came back from work,
>
> and I went into the bathroom,
>
> and, oh, my God, it looked like a crime scene movie.
>
> There was blood on the mirror, blood in the sink,
>
> drops of blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around,
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, my daughter showed up,
>
> and she said, "Hey, Dad, I got my period."
>
> So after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> I was like, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, obviously, I am not at all qualified to buy tampons,
>
> but I thought, hey, this can't be so hard,
>
> so I went back to my girl wearing a wig.
>
> And I took a little look around,
>
> and what I found is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon,
>
> because, you know, you have names like Obie Price,
>
> what professional women have believed for a living.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> You know, what are we talking here, glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> When you need to get it in when the lights are off, I don't know.
>
> Or the one I actually liked the most was Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfitable black hole.
>
> But, you know, in the end,
>
> I ended up choosing a different product.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> At about 10 o'clock, it starts leaking,
>
> and she is always home by 11.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thanks for that, because I also felt really proud after this,
>
> because, you know, it's not every day as a father
>
> that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> I think that's true.
>
> Thank you, you guys, for coming.
>
> And with that, ladies and gentlemen,
>
> we are finished with the open mic tonight.
>
> Thank you all so much for coming.
