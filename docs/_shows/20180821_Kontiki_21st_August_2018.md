> So I went over to Migros, took a look around, and what I discovered is that
>
> tampon product names are actually no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a
>
> tampon.
>
> For example, you have OB Pro.
>
> You're already there.
>
> Professional women that bleed for a living.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance, like what, Glow-in-the-Dark tampon?
>
> But the one I liked the most was Always Infinity, for when your vagina is an
>
> unfillable black hole.
>
> Anyway, I ended up choosing something that worked for my daughter, it went okay.
>
> And it ended up being a very proud moment for me, because as a father, it's not
>
> often that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> I thought actually I was going to freak you out, that that might be like a
>
> little bit incest-y, that joke, to clean your vaginas, but actually, I also
>
> have a son, and he's a gamer, and recently he's been playing Fortnite.
>
> Now, for those of you that don't know, Fortnite, it's a shooter, you play
>
> online against other people, and the owners of Fortnite recently claimed that
>
> they had 125 million players online.
>
> At the same time, and this is so many kids that people are starting to say that
>
> they're ruining an entire generation.
>
> But for me as a father, actually, I see my son is learning some great life
>
> skills from Fortnite.
>
> For example, he's learned that he can sit in a chair for eight hours without
>
> moving, eating, or going to a toilet.
>
> And this is clearly great preparation for office life.
>
> Or...
>
> His evasion.
>
> His evasion skills have become fantastic.
>
> He completely avoids going out, doing any exercise, or meeting his friends.
>
> And, in fact, the thing that I like most, though, is his English has become
>
> really good.
>
> He plays against American players often, and he's learned some key phrases like,
>
> Bitch, I will fuck you up!
>
> And, I will piss on you like you're Donald Trump!
>
> The one I like most is just,
>
> Hey!
>
> Hey, man, I heard you were born out of your mom's asshole.
>
> So, yeah, this generation, I don't think we actually really need to worry about.
>
> We've got about 10, 20 years before they grow up and start taking over society
>
> from us.
>
> But, actually, I think there's a bigger threat coming before then.
>
> Maybe in the next 5 to 10 years.
>
> Because I read recently that we're that close to perfecting human cloning.
>
> Now, for me, human cloning is a really interesting topic.
>
> Because I've always wondered, what would it be like to meet your own clone?
>
> And, the more I think about this, unfortunately, I think it wouldn't go very
>
> well.
>
> Because I'm pretty sure we'd meet each other, and we'd probably kind of hate
>
> each other.
>
> We're both kind of two bossy, arrogant assholes.
>
> And there'd be this kind of awkward silence where we'd find we've got nothing
>
> to say.
>
> And then one or the other of us would go,
>
> So, how about a handjob?
>
> Now, think about this for a moment.
>
> Your clone is going to have an intimate knowledge of your penis.
>
> We're actually talking the greatest handjob that you're ever going to
>
> experience.
>
> And, in fact, probably things are going to escalate from there.
>
> And we're going to be thinking, "Hmm, I wonder if it's gay to blow your clone?"
>
> And it probably gets worse, like, "And now, spit or swallow?"
>
> So, this type of incest, I see you're not so cool about it.
>
> Yeah, I mean, from there, of course, it's going to go into this inevitable
>
> cycle of regret and self-loathing and blaming the other one.
>
> "Why did you talk me into this disgusting act?"
>
> And there'd be another long silence and awkwardness, and then one of us would
>
> say,
>
> "How about another handjob?"
>
> And I think, unfortunately, this is where the human race is going.
>
> Instead of going,
>
> out living our lives, going to work, etc.,
>
> we're just all going to be stuck at home getting amazing handjobs from someone
>
> we despise.
>
> All right, I'm going to leave you with that thought for the video.
>
> Thanks a lot and good night.
