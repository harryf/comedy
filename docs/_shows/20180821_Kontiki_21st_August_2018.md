<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> So I went over to Meegle, took a look around, and what I discovered is that
>
> tampon product names are actually no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a
>
> tampon.
>
> For example, you have "OB Pro".
>
> You're already there.
>
> "Professional Women That Bleed For a Living".
>
> Or "Tampax Radiance".
>
> Like, what, "Glow-In-The-Dark" tampon?
>
> But the one I liked the most was "Always Infinity".
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> Anyway, I ended up choosing something for my daughter. It went okay.
>
> And it ended up being a very proud moment for me, because as a father it's not
>
> often
>
> that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> I thought actually I was going to freak you out, that that might be a little
>
> incest-y, that joke.
>
> Clearly you're all used to this.
>
> Actually, I also have a son. He's a gamer.
>
> And recently he's been playing Fortnite.
>
> Now, for those of you that don't know, Fortnite is a shooter you play online
>
> against other people.
>
> And the owners of Fortnite recently claimed that they had 125 million players
>
> online at the same time.
>
> And this is so many kids that people are starting to say they're ruining an
>
> entire generation.
>
> But for me as a father, actually, I see my son is learning some great life
>
> skills from Fortnite.
>
> For example, he's learned that he can sit in a chair for eight hours without
>
> moving, eating, or going to a toilet.
>
> And this is clearly great preparation for office life.
>
> Or his evasion skills have become fantastic.
>
> He completely avoids going out, doing any exercise, or meeting his friends.
>
> And in fact, the thing that I like most, though, is his English has become
>
> really good.
>
> He plays against American players often.
>
> And he's learned some key phrases like, "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> And, "I will piss on you like you're Donald Trump!"
>
> The one I like most is just, "Hey man, I heard you were born out of your mom's
>
> asshole."
>
> So, yeah, this generation I don't think we actually really need to worry about.
>
> We've got about 10-20 years before they grow up and start taking over society
>
> from us.
>
> But actually I think there's a bigger threat coming before then.
>
> Maybe in the next 5-10 years, because I read recently that we're that close to
>
> perfecting human cloning.
>
> Now, for me, human cloning is a really interesting topic.
>
> Because I've always wondered, what would it be like to meet your own clone?
>
> And the more I think about this, unfortunately, I think it wouldn't go very
>
> well.
>
> Because I'm pretty sure we'd meet each other and we'd probably kind of hate
>
> each other.
>
> We're both kind of two bossy, arrogant assholes.
>
> And there'd be this kind of awkward silence where we'd find we've got nothing
>
> to say.
>
> And then one or the other of us would go, "So how about a handjob?"
>
> Now, think about this for a moment.
>
> Your clone is going to have an intimate knowledge of your penis.
>
> We're actually talking the greatest handjob you're ever going to experience.
>
> And in fact, probably things are going to escalate from there.
>
> We're going to be thinking, "Hmm, I wonder if it's gay to blow your clone."
>
> And it probably gets worse, like, "And now, spit or swallow?"
>
> So this type of incest I see you're not so cool about.
>
> Yeah, I mean, from there, of course, it's going to go into this inevitable
>
> cycle of regret
>
> and self-loathing and blaming the other one.
>
> "Why did you talk me into this disgusting act?"
>
> And there'd be another long silence and awkwardness.
>
> And then one of us would say, "How about another handjob?"
>
> And I think, unfortunately, this is where the human race is going.
>
> Instead of going out, living our lives, going to work, et cetera,
>
> we're just all going to be stuck at home getting amazing handjobs from someone
>
> we despise.
>
> All right, I'm going to leave you with that thought.
>
> Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.
