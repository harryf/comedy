> So it's actually not Harry Fox, some of you may know this, it's Harry Fuchs, it's
>
> actually
>
> a German name, but as we've got an English speaking audience, you all think I'm
>
> Harry
>
> Fox.
>
> And, you know, this is a problem because when we have like a family get
>
> together, we get
>
> very upset if you start thinking that we're a group of fuckers, because clearly
>
> we're
>
> a pack of fucks.
>
> But in fact, I have twins, I'm a father, and I named them Howler and Whatler.
>
> I don't want to ruin their lives, but that's where it goes.
>
> Sometimes, actually, people approach me about my name, I recently had this
>
> American guy
>
> come up to me and he said, yo, Harry Fuchs, man, Harry Fuchs what?
>
> I'm like, what?
>
> He's like, Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> So I thought I'd throw him off with some adverbs like Harry Fuchs, hopefully,
>
> Harry
>
> Fuchs occasionally, Harry Fuchs enthusiastically, he was like, no, no, man, no,
>
> Harry Fuchs
>
> chickens, man, Harry Fuchs goats, Harry Fuchs tigers.
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure in the entire history of
>
> mankind, no
>
> one has successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> In fact, I got to thinking about this, there's actually a whole class of
>
> animals that have
>
> never been fucked.
>
> Like, take hippos, for example, you get behind a hippo, you might think, hey,
>
> this is looking
>
> good, it's kind of squidgy, I can just slide in there, but what you may not
>
> know is that
>
> hippos are the most dangerous mammal in Africa, they kill the most people every
>
> year.
>
> Or, of course, elephants, you can't fuck elephants, just too high.
>
> You'd be like, oh, oh, it's not going to reach, maybe you pull on the tail, it's
>
> still
>
> not going to work.
>
> Of course, if the mum's not watching, you could fuck a baby elephant.
>
> I'm getting a level with you.
>
> You're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> You need to think about that too when you're talking about me.
>
> Yeah, but anyway, so Harry Fuchs.
>
> It sets a high level of expectations, people think I fuck a lot, that's not
>
> true, but actually
>
> recently, I kind of got lucky thanks to Tinder, I went on a date with a lady,
>
> went very well,
>
> we went back to her place, one thing led to another, just to help you visualise,
>
> I was
>
> kind of going down and kind of fondled her breasts, and I can also see you all
>
> now, this
>
> is great, and I was kind of kissing her stomach, and I pulled down her panties,
>
> and her panties
>
> were shaved, but she had a tattoo that said, Fifi, and at that moment, I just
>
> lost it,
>
> I broke down, I started sobbing on control of the tears streaming down, and
>
> that was
>
> basically me being a pussy in front of a pussy, and the reason for this is
>
> actually
>
> because when I was seven years old, I had a hamster called Fifi, and my last
>
> memory
>
> of Fifi was, Fifi was running around our flat, kind of happy.
>
> Fifi started crawling up this tower of books that was stacked on the floor, and
>
> I wasn't
>
> paying attention, and I looked, and I saw this tower of books starting to tip,
>
> and I
>
> went, no, Fifi, and the last thing I heard was this crunch, as a hardback book
>
> about
>
> how to care for your rodent crush, and this traumatic experience just came back
>
> to me,
>
> and combined with the pressure of trying to please a woman, it just cracked me,
>
> and this
>
> is actually something I think that maybe all of us have experienced, and I
>
> think it's
>
> something all the women here should consider, you know, guys act tough, we act
>
> like we know
>
> what we're doing, but we all know, actually, we know that we suck at all things
>
> sex, and
>
> we hear you guys, you know, you fake orgasms, we hear you joking with your
>
> friend about
>
> how bad this guy was last night, so what you need to consider is that maybe use
>
> this space
>
> above your vagina as an opportunity to comfort a guy.
>
> For example, you know, let's say you've got a boyfriend, he's a hipster, try
>
> growing
>
> out a nice hipster beard down there, get some beard oil in there, he'll be,
>
> when he gets
>
> down there, he'll be like, yo, bro, bro fist, he's gonna love it, or, you know,
>
> if he's
>
> more of a student, like more of a thinker, you know, you could try tattooing
>
> some metaphysical
>
> question, you know, like, who decides what is good and evil, and that's gonna
>
> keep him
>
> down there for way longer than he needs to be, or, but, you know, I don't know,
>
> I don't
>
> know, but, of course, he, you know, the typical scenario is you meet a guy in a
>
> bar, he's
>
> been drinking a lot of beer, and what do guys really love after a night of
>
> drinking beer?
>
> It's a Danica bag, so go buy a Danica bag, take a few strips of meat, stick
>
> them above
>
> your vagina, and when he goes down there, he will love you forever, but just
>
> watch out,
>
> one tip is, don't go for extra sharp, we don't want any vaginal injuries.
>
> Okay, that's me.
>
> That was Henry Fox, everybody.
