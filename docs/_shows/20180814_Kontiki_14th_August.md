> So it's actually not Harry Fuchs, some of you may know this, it's Harry Fuchs,
>
> it's
>
> actually a German name, but as we've got an English speaking audience, you all
>
> think I'm
>
> Harry Fuchs.
>
> And, you know, this is a problem because when we have like a family get-together,
>
> we get
>
> very upset if you start thinking that we're a group of fuckers, because clearly
>
> we're
>
> a pack of fucks.
>
> But in fact I have twins, I'm a father, and I named them Hal the and Watt the,
>
> it ruined
>
> their lives, but sometimes actually people approach me about my name.
>
> I recently had this American guy come up to me and he said, "Yo, Harry Fuchs,
>
> man.
>
> Harry Fuchs what?"
>
> I'm like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> So I thought I'd throw him off with some adverbs like, "Harry Fuchs hopefully,"
>
> "Harry Fuchs
>
> occasionally," "Harry Fuchs enthusiastically," he was like, "No, no, man, no,
>
> Harry Fuchs
>
> chickens, man, Harry Fuchs goats, Harry Fuchs tigers."
>
> Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure in the entire history of
>
> mankind, no
>
> one has successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> In fact, I got to thinking about this, there's actually a whole class of
>
> animals that have
>
> never been fucked.
>
> Like, take hippos, for example.
>
> You get behind a hippo, you might think, "Hey, this is looking good, it's kind
>
> of squidgy,"
>
> and they slide in there, but what you may not know is that hippos are the most
>
> dangerous
>
> mammal in Africa, they kill the most people every year.
>
> Or, of course, elephants, you can't fuck elephants just too hot, you'd be like,
>
> "Oh, oh," it's
>
> not going to reach, maybe you pull on the tail, it's still not going to work.
>
> Of course, if the mom's not watching, you could fuck a baby elephant.
>
> I'm getting a level with you, you're okay with bestiality, but not pedophile
>
> bestiality.
>
> You need to think about that when you're growing up.
>
> Anyway, so Harry fucks, it sets a high level of expectations, people think I
>
> fuck a lot,
>
> that's not true, but actually, recently, I kind of got lucky thanks to Tinder,
>
> I went
>
> on a date with a lady, went very well, we went back to her place, one thing led
>
> to another.
>
> Just to help you visualize, I was going down and fondled her breasts, and I can
>
> also see
>
> you all now, this is great, and I was kissing her stomach, and I pulled down
>
> her panties,
>
> and her pubes were shaped that she had a tattoo that said, "Fifi," and at that
>
> moment, I just
>
> lost it, I broke down, I started sobbing uncontrollably, tears streaming down,
>
> and that was basically
>
> me being a pussy in front of a pussy.
>
> The reason for this is actually because when I was seven years old, I had a hamster
>
> called
>
> Fifi.
>
> And my last memory of Fifi was, Fifi was running around our flat, kind of happy,
>
> and Fifi started
>
> crawling up this tower of books that was stacked on the floor, and I wasn't
>
> paying attention,
>
> and I looked, and I saw this tower of books starting to tip, and I went, "No, Fifi!"
>
> And the last thing I heard was this crunch, as a hardback book about how to
>
> care for your
>
> rodent crush.
>
> And this traumatic experience just came back to me, and combined with the
>
> pressure of trying
>
> to please a woman, it just cracked me.
>
> This is actually something I think that maybe all the women here should
>
> consider.
>
> You know, guys act tough, we act like we know what we're doing, but we all know,
>
> actually,
>
> we know that we suck at all things sex, and we hear you guys, you know, you
>
> fake orgasms,
>
> we hear you joking with your friend about how bad this guy was last night.
>
> So what you need to consider is that maybe use this space above your vagina as
>
> an opportunity
>
> to comfort a guy.
>
> For example, you know, let's say you've got a boyfriend, he's a hipster.
>
> Try growing out a nice hipster beard down here, put some beard oil in there.
>
> Maybe when he gets down there, he'll be like, "Yo, bro, brofist!"
>
> He's gonna love it.
>
> Or, you know, if he's more of a student, like more of a thinker, you know, you
>
> could try
>
> tattooing some metaphysical question, you know, like, "Who decides what is good
>
> and
>
> evil?"
>
> And that's going to keep him down there for way longer than he needs to be.
>
> But of course, you know, the typical scenario is you meet a guy in a bar, he's
>
> been drinking
>
> a lot of beer, and what do guys really love after a night of drinking beer?
>
> It's a Doner Kebab.
>
> So go buy a Doner Kebab, take a few strips of meat, stick 'em above your vagina,
>
> and
>
> when he goes down there, he will love you forever.
>
> But just watch out, one tip is, don't go for extra shots, we don't want any vaginal
>
> injuries.
>
> Okay, that's me.
>
> Thanks a lot.
