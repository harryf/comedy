> I think it's going to be an easy night tonight.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs, it's a German name.
>
> I think I'm going to tell a story about my great-grandfather, just to drum it
>
> down a
>
> bit.
>
> So, yeah, my name is Harry Fuchs, it's a German name, and unfortunately, I'm
>
> just not going
>
> to need to tell any jokes tonight, because I need to stop being a joke.
>
> When I'm in a group of, in a room of English speakers like this, of course you'll
>
> think
>
> my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs, I stand as far away from this as possible.
>
> In fact, in my family, in my family, we get very upset when we have a family
>
> reunion and
>
> they call us a group of fuckers, because we're clearly a pack of fucks.
>
> Actually, I'm a single dad, I have two teenage kids, I call them "how the" and
>
> "what the".
>
> I'm meant to be a good spouse, but yeah, it's tricky with this name, recently
>
> this American
>
> guy came up to me with enthusiasm, like all Americans, he's like, "Hey, man,
>
> Harry Fuchs,
>
> Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Yeah, Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Hmm," so I thought I'd throw him off with a few adverbs, like "Harry
>
> Fuchs
>
> hopefully," "Harry Fuchs occasionally," "Harry Fuchs enthusiast," but he's like,
>
> "No, man,
>
> Harry Fuchs goats, man, Harry Fuchs chickens, Harry Fuchs tigers."
>
> I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure in the entire history of mankind,
>
> no one has
>
> successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> Probably a few people got fucked up by a tiger, but it made me realize that
>
> there's actually
>
> a whole class of unfuckable animals, like hippos, for example.
>
> You may get up behind a hippo and think, "Wow, that is a great ass," just slide
>
> on in there,
>
> but don't do it, because hippos are actually the most dangerous mammal, they
>
> kill about
>
> 500 people every year, so don't do that.
>
> Don't do elephants either, because you're going to find it's too high up.
>
> You may be like, "Yeah, of course, it's huge," but it's not going to reach, it's
>
> just too
>
> far.
>
> Of course, if the mom's not watching, you could probably fuck a baby elephant.
>
> I'm just finding your level, so you're good with bestiality, you're pretty much
>
> a pedophile
>
> this year.
>
> I'm trying to keep away from that, but it's true, I do have a lot of dark
>
> thoughts, and
>
> this actually, I think it goes back to my childhood, because I went to a
>
> Catholic school,
>
> but I got thrown out for molesting a priest, and actually, I think there I
>
> found the solution
>
> to a big problem we're having.
>
> Every time a priest molests a child, we need to get out there, on the streets,
>
> go out and
>
> molest a priest, be like, "Butt man and raping, vigilante justice, we can clear
>
> this up in
>
> a month or so."
>
> Okay, so, okay, it's not comfortable with the Catholic pedo-politics.
>
> Yeah, I don't know, it's tough, but it's also tough being a guy these days,
>
> because society
>
> thinks so many bad things about us, and okay, it's justified, men did all the
>
> bad shit in
>
> history, but recently I found out, I'm guilty of this myself, I just think bad
>
> stuff about
>
> men, you know, I was on a tram, and there's a couple, and there's a guy kissing
>
> a girl,
>
> and then I noticed that the girl actually had Down syndrome, and I thought, "That
>
> sly
>
> motherfucker."
>
> Now think about this, like, if that had been a woman, and the guy had Down
>
> syndrome, I
>
> would have been thinking like, "Wow, what a wonderful person she is, that she
>
> can carry
>
> the responsibility, the burden of having a relationship with someone with a
>
> disability,
>
> like, she is the greatest person ever."
>
> But when I saw this guy, I was like, "Motherfucker."
>
> Because you know what he's doing, you know, he's tapped into the unlimited
>
> source of free
>
> sex.
>
> Now, you may not know this about people with Down syndrome, they're very
>
> affectionate,
>
> sometimes that crosses into sexual behavior, and probably this guy is like, "Hey,
>
> you
>
> know, honey, it's time to play the lollipop game."
>
> We've got very bad luck tonight, I'm sorry.
>
> Because he's probably got another game, like, you know, hide the rabbit, which
>
> holds tonight.
>
> We're getting there, you're finding that sex with Down syndrome funny.
>
> In fact, they're still, they're like, "We're getting out of this."
>
> But you know, it's tough, but this is the kind of stuff that society thinks
>
> about men,
>
> and you know, I feel this personally because, you know, I'm in my mid-forties,
>
> I'm bald,
>
> beard, white, you know, all the things that people hate.
>
> It's like, you hear about me on the news, a man was seen running, witnesses say
>
> he was
>
> in his mid-forties, white, shaved with a beard.
>
> It's like everyone thinks I'm some kind of serial rapist.
>
> And you know, and this is tough because, you know, when you're dealing with
>
> this all the
>
> time, you realize that there's something which I've started to call the rapiness
>
> scale.
>
> And this is a scale that, like, out here you've got, like, the axe murderers,
>
> the serial killers,
>
> these kind of people.
>
> But over here on the left, you've got the friend zone.
>
> And you know, the nice guys out there that are in the friend zone, every time,
>
> like,
>
> they need to go, they're like, where am I going to put myself?
>
> I've got to get out of the friend zone.
>
> I've got to get a bit more creepy.
>
> But for me, I'm coming this way.
>
> That's a very nice dress you have on.
>
> Doesn't matter what I do, though.
>
> It's just still creepy.
>
> My one tip to all the guys here is when you're on a date, never start with this.
>
> I just want you to know I'm not a rapist.
>
> It never goes well for me.
>
> Thank you.
