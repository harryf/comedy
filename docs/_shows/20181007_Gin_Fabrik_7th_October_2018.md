> Fox everybody, give it up!
>
> I think it's going to be an easy night tonight.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs, it's a German name.
>
> I think I'm going to tell a story about my great-grandfather.
>
> I'm going to turn it down a bit.
>
> So, yeah, my name is Harry Fuchs, it's a German name.
>
> Unfortunately, I'm just not going to need to tell any jokes tonight.
>
> Because I need to stop being an idiot.
>
> When I'm in a group of, in a room of English speakers like this, of course you'll
>
> think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> You can understand it as far away from me.
>
> You can understand this as far away.
>
> In fact, in my family, in my family we get very upset when we have a family
>
> reunion if they call us a group of fuckers.
>
> Because we're clearly a pack of fucks.
>
> See, I'm a single dad, I have two teenage kids, I call them "how-the" and "what-the".
>
> I'm going to tell them it'll be all spot on.
>
> But, yeah, it's tricky with this name.
>
> Recently, this American guy came up to me with, you know, like, enthusiasm,
>
> like a little American.
>
> He's like, "Hey, man, Harry Fuchs. Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "What?"
>
> And he's like, "Yeah, Harry Fuchs what, man?"
>
> And I'm like, "Hmm."
>
> So I thought I'd throw him off with a few adverbs, like, "Harry Fuchs hopefully."
>
> "Harry Fuchs occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fuchs enthusiastically."
>
> But he's like, "No, man. Harry Fuchs goats, man. Harry Fuchs chickens. Harry Fuchs
>
> tigers."
>
> I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure in the entire history of mankind,
>
> no one has successfully fucked a tiger.
>
> Probably a few people got fucked up by a tiger.
>
> And it made me realize that there's actually a whole class of unfuckable
>
> animals.
>
> Like hippos, for example.
>
> You may get up behind a hippo and think, "Wow, that is a great ass."
>
> Just slide on in there.
>
> But don't do it, because hippos are actually the most dangerous mammal.
>
> They kill about 500 people every year.
>
> Yeah, so don't do that.
>
> Don't do...
>
> Don't do elephants either, because you're going to find it's too high up.
>
> You know, you may be like, "Yeah."
>
> Of course, it's huge, but it's not going to reach.
>
> It's just too far.
>
> Of course, if the mom's not watching, you could probably fuck a baby up.
>
> All right, I'm just finding your level.
>
> So you're good with bestiality.
>
> You're not going to petrify the bestiality.
>
> I'll try and keep away from that.
>
> But it's true, I do have a lot of dark thoughts, you know.
>
> And this actually, I think it goes back to my childhood.
>
> Because I went to a Catholic school.
>
> But I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> And actually, I think there is actually...
>
> I found the solution to a big problem we're having, you know.
>
> Every time a priest molests a child, we need to get out there on the streets,
>
> go out and molest the priest.
>
> Be like, "Butt man and rape him."
>
> Vigilante justice.
>
> We can clear this up in a month or so.
>
> Okay, so...
>
> Okay, it's not comfortable with the Catholic people.
>
> Yeah, I don't know.
>
> It's tough.
>
> But, you know, it's also tough being a guy these days.
>
> Because society thinks so many bad things about us, you know.
>
> And, okay, it's justified.
>
> Men did all the bad shit in history.
>
> But, you know, recently I found that I'm guilty of this myself.
>
> I just think bad stuff about men, you know.
>
> I was on a tramp.
>
> And there's a couple.
>
> And there's a guy kissing a girl.
>
> And then I noticed that the girl actually had Down syndrome.
>
> And I thought, "That slime motherfucker."
>
> Now, think about this.
>
> Like, if that had been a woman and the guy had Down syndrome,
>
> I would have been thinking, like, "Wow, what a wonderful person she is."
>
> That she can carry the responsibility, the burden of having a relationship with
>
> someone with a disability.
>
> Like, she is the greatest person ever.
>
> But when I saw this guy, I was like, "Motherfucker."
>
> Because you know what he's doing, you know.
>
> He's tapped into the unlimited source of free sex.
>
> Now, you know, you may not know this about people with Down syndrome.
>
> They're very affectionate.
>
> Sometimes that crosses into sexual behavior.
>
> And probably this guy is like, "Hey, you know, honey, it's time to play the lollipop
>
> game."
>
> "I'm very bad tonight. I'm sorry."
>
> Because he's probably got another game like, you know, "Hide the Rabbit."
>
> Which holds tonight.
>
> We're getting there.
>
> You're finding that sex with Down syndrome is funny.
>
> In fact, they're still, they're like, "We're getting out of this."
>
> But, you know, it's tough.
>
> But this is the kind of stuff that society thinks about men.
>
> And, you know, I feel this personally because, you know, I'm in my mid-forties.
>
> I'm bald.
>
> Beard.
>
> White.
>
> You know, all the things that people hate.
>
> You know, it's like you hear about me on the news.
>
> A man was seen running.
>
> Witnesses say he was in his mid-forties, white, shaved with a beard.
>
> You know, it's like everyone thinks I'm some kind of serial rapist.
>
> And, you know, this is tough because, you know, when you're dealing with this
>
> all the time,
>
> you realize that there's something which I've started to call the rapiness.
>
> And this is a scale that, like, out here you've got like the axe murderers, the
>
> serial killers,
>
> these kind of people.
>
> But over here on the left, you've got the friend zone.
>
> And, you know, the nice guys out there that are in the friend zone, every time,
>
> like,
>
> they meet the girl, they're like, "Where am I going to put myself?
>
> I've got to get out of the friend zone.
>
> I've got to get a bit more pretty.
>
> But for me, I'm coming this way."
>
> "That's a very nice dress you have on."
>
> It doesn't matter what I do, though.
>
> It's just still creepy.
>
> My one tip to all the guys here is when you're on a date, never start with, "Listen,
>
> I just
>
> want you to know I'm not a rapist."
>
> It never goes well from there.
>
> Okay, thank you.
>
> Give it up for Harry, everybody.
