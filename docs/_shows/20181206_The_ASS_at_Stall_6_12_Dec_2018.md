<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> That a lot man. Now, we only have one last comedian left in our first act and
>
> we're going to take a little break.
>
> Our last act was from France. This next act is from England.
>
> He's been living here in Zurich for a long time now.
>
> And yeah, I want you guys to really go crazy for him. He's very funny.
>
> Everybody, give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> Give it up, please!
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Books.
>
> That's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> So, for you expats here that speak English, it is not Harry Fox.
>
> In my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you
>
> call us a group of fuckers.
>
> I'm not sure we ever have the fuckers.
>
> I have two kids. I call them Halberd and Walker.
>
> I just wanted to get rid of the stuttering.
>
> But it is a burden. It's a burden living with this name, especially with
>
> Americans.
>
> Recently, an American guy came up to me and was like, "Yo, what's up, man?
>
> Harry Fox! Harry Fox what, man? Harry Fox what?"
>
> I was like, "What?"
>
> He was like, "Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> I was like, "Hmm, let me throw him off with some adverts like 'Harry Fox
>
> Hopefully'."
>
> "Harry Fox Occasionally."
>
> "Harry Fox Enthusiastically."
>
> He's like, "No, no, man. Harry Fox Goats, man. Harry Fox Chickens. Harry Fox
>
> Tigers."
>
> I'm like, "Jesus, man. This guy."
>
> Because in the history of mankind, I'm pretty sure no one has ever successfully
>
> fucked a tiger.
>
> In fact, it made me realize that there's actually a whole category of unfuckable
>
> animals.
>
> Take hippos, for example.
>
> You may get up behind a hippo and think, "Wow, that is a great answer."
>
> Do not do it. Hippos get very pissed off about this.
>
> They actually kill the most people in Africa every year, about 500.
>
> Another animal you can't fuck is elephants, you know, because it's just too
>
> high up.
>
> There's probably some guys who are like, "I could do that."
>
> Yeah, you know, they won't.
>
> But, you know, I mean, if the mom's not watching, you could probably fuck a
>
> baby elephant.
>
> All right, I'm just finding your levels.
>
> What I'm getting is you're good with bestiality, but not pedophile bestiality.
>
> So I'll try and keep it a little bit cleaner.
>
> But the problem, I have to admit, it is me, because I have a lot of dark
>
> thoughts going on in my head.
>
> And I think it goes back to my childhood.
>
> I went to a Catholic school, and I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> But, you know, it is a stark and strange—do we have any Ph.D. students here
>
> tonight?
>
> Any Ph.D. students that are insane enough to admit to it?
>
> Anyone who once had a Ph.D.?
>
> Well, you're all too stupid.
>
> I set up for this joke. I never did a Ph.D. either.
>
> But think of a Ph.D. student that you really dislike, there's jokes about him.
>
> Because you know who the most sexually frustrated, raged, like, frustration
>
> people on the planet are today?
>
> Ph.D. students.
>
> And the reason for this, like, imagine a Ph.D. student, he's, like, done 15
>
> hours on a laptop.
>
> It's 3 a.m., and he's still typing away, and he's got a head full of
>
> statistical models and equations.
>
> How is this guy ever going to get to sleep?
>
> And then, oops, uptown, he's over on PornHub.
>
> And there's a big mental leak that just happened there.
>
> And, you know, the average Ph.D. takes about 8 years to complete.
>
> Do you know how dark his habits have become after 8 years of doing this?
>
> We're no longer into good, wholesome porn.
>
> We're, like, deep into BDSM and tentacles and, like, dwarves riding on ponies.
>
> And then after completing his Ph.D., this guy gets his dream job at a place
>
> like Google.
>
> And they put him in an office with 10 other horny Ph.D. students.
>
> Now, you may have noticed that last month, 20,000 Google employees walked out
>
> to protest sexual harassment.
>
> Were we really surprised by this?
>
> They're like, "Oh, shit, I just can't take it anymore. I've got to get the fuck
>
> out. It's like an orgy every day, man.
>
> I can't take it."
>
> But, you know, there is a solution to this.
>
> This is a solution that might even be a step towards world peace.
>
> Sex robots.
>
> You know, you're thinking about this. It's a hard question.
>
> Sex robots. Technology can solve everything.
>
> Because imagine if Google gave all their staff a sex box for Christmas.
>
> You know, the whole problem is solved because, you know, they'd come out, they'd
>
> announce,
>
> "Yeah, we gave all our staff sex bots. We've reduced cases of sexual harassment
>
> by 83%.
>
> We're tracking our staff with sex bot analytics. It's great.
>
> And since we gave all our staff sex bots, they are more focused and productive."
>
> This is a kind of a solution.
>
> Probably from here, you know, like the idea of, like, sex bots will become
>
> mainstream
>
> because, you know, a normal human instinct sort of being so frustrated in so
>
> many single people.
>
> The solution is sex robots.
>
> Anthony, Anthony, would you buy a sex robot?
>
> He said yes.
>
> So, and, you know, once this happens, the big guys are going to be like,
>
> "This is a billion dollar market."
>
> And you have, like, "We brought you the iPad. We brought you the iPhone.
>
> Today, we're bringing you the iFuck."
>
> And they'll be followed by Google Ho.
>
> And Amazon will be like, "Oh, shit. What are we going to do? We've got to keep
>
> up with these guys.
>
> Let's put Alexa with drones. We call it the Flying Fuck."
>
> But, I mean, if you imagine a world where, like, sex bots are mainstream,
>
> and it's just normal, like, having a phone, you have a sex bot.
>
> You know, it's like, you invite your bros around for drinks,
>
> and then the next morning, you go to text your friend, like,
>
> "Hey, dude, last night, did you fuck my sex bot?
>
> I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry she came on to me. I couldn't help myself."
>
> And then you're like, "Dude, for fuck's sake, man, you didn't even wash her out."
>
> Yeah, we're going to need sex bot security.
>
> It's going to be like swipe your dick to get in.
>
> But, yeah, you know, I mean, it's a strange world, technology and sex, how
>
> these things mix, you know.
>
> I'm from the U.K., and recently I read a U.K. study of the use of phones,
>
> particularly in related to sexual matters.
>
> And what they found is that men between the ages of 20 and 40,
>
> an amazing 50% have sent a dick pic in the last month.
>
> 50%. Now, that's a hard number to imagine.
>
> But for the ladies here, that would be a bit like,
>
> you give your phone number to ten guys here,
>
> and for Christmas you've got a stack of five dicks on the phone.
>
> I don't take dick pics myself, not because I'm better than that,
>
> but it's actually because I'm a bit of a perfectionist.
>
> Because a quality dick pic is hard, you know.
>
> It's like, you've got a lot to think about.
>
> The lighting, you go for some soft tones to bring out the fleshy colors.
>
> Maybe some red lighting, something more erotic.
>
> Do you need some props, like some roses,
>
> just kind of a dick sticking through?
>
> That's probably dangerous. I'm not going to do that.
>
> And what about the angle? It's like the selfie problem.
>
> How do I do this?
>
> Luckily, though, I am a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> That's why I invented the dick pic selfie stick.
>
> You can get it from dickpicselfiestick.com, $29.99.
>
> It is the perfect gift for Anthony.
>
> Thank you. Thanks a lot. You've been great.
