> Okay folks, we got two more comedians left in our first half. I want to bring
>
> up this
>
> next comedian. He's originally British but he's been living here in Switzerland
>
> for a
>
> very long time and we're very happy to have him. Ladies and gentlemen, make
>
> some noise
>
> for Harry Fuchs! So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name. It's
>
> spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S. Of course in a room with English speakers like this a lot
>
> of you think
>
> my name is Harry Fuchs. My name is not Harry Fuchs. The problem with a name
>
> like Harry
>
> Fuchs is it sets a very high level of expectation. And I'm about here on the
>
> reality. In fact
>
> this is something that I'm kind of a bit insecure about, honestly, because I've
>
> got this far
>
> in life and honestly I still don't really know if I'm any good at sex. Because
>
> recently
>
> I was reading to be good at anything, you need to do it for 10,000 hours. 10,000
>
> hours
>
> is a lot of fucking. If I try and add it up, I think maybe I've got to about 5,000
>
> if I
>
> count masturbation. So it's very depressing because I just don't see that there's
>
> any
>
> chance that I'm going to attain this goal. I'm just never going to make it into
>
> the frequent
>
> fucker program. This kind of depression has been weighing on me. It weighs on
>
> me on nights
>
> like tonight because what's even more depressing is right here, right now, you
>
> all suck at
>
> sex too. There is no way that any of you have 10,000 hours. If you fuck for 24
>
> hours a day
>
> for a whole year, you're only at 8,000 hours. I've done the maths on this. If
>
> you live for
>
> 70 years, you need to fuck for 11 times a day from the day you're born. And I
>
> don't
>
> know what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking or old people
>
> fucking
>
> on the day they die. It's brutal stuff. Of course, at this point, some of you
>
> are thinking,
>
> "This is bullshit. I'm good at sex." Like Yang, for example. "I am into
>
> sustainability.
>
> I can sustain all night." Yang, I hate to tell you this, only two types of
>
> people think
>
> they're good at sex, prostitutes and compulsive liars. Stop lying, Yang. You
>
> know you're a
>
> ho. We've got some ladies here. They can pimp you anytime you like. You didn't
>
> get pimping?
>
> What I learned is you never connect a recruitment person to pimping. That's not
>
> cool. You see
>
> how they're just all in dead silent? Yeah, but this is kind of a tough thing.
>
> But I think
>
> actually the real problem here is as men and women, we don't really understand
>
> what the
>
> other half enjoys about sex. Let's be honest here. Recently, I went on a date
>
> with a girl.
>
> We ended up in bed together, and she didn't even know where her own clitoris
>
> was. She
>
> couldn't tell me. I'm like, "Where's the clitoris?" And she didn't know. Of
>
> course, it might have
>
> been that I forgot to take the gag out. I can't remember. But it's hard. But
>
> recently,
>
> it hit me. There is actually a simple solution to this. It's a simple thing
>
> that works only
>
> in Zurich. If you take a number three tram through the city, it's going to stop
>
> at places
>
> that will blow your mind. The first place it's going to stop is outside Sensuelle.
>
> Sensuelle
>
> is a sex shop for women. And if you go in Sensuelle, you'll find it's full of
>
> feathers
>
> and aromas and sexy underwear and erotic books. Because for women, a lot of sex
>
> is about what's
>
> in their head. What's in their head. And I think that means I need to put my
>
> dick in
>
> her mouth. No one followed me to here. You all are a bunch of sick people. I'm
>
> in the
>
> right place. But let's get back on the tram. Let's get back on the tram. You
>
> carry on on
>
> your tram journey. Go a few more stops. And eventually, it's going to stop
>
> outside a sex
>
> shop for men. And that place is called the erotic factory. The erotic factory.
>
> Because
>
> for men, nothing is more erotic than a factory. Full of underpaid workers. In a
>
> third world
>
> country. But if you think about it, just think about it. Everything you need to
>
> know about
>
> men and men's sex drive is just in that name. Erotic factory, it says it all.
>
> And between
>
> the erotic factory and Sensuelle, we can see that there is a wide gap between
>
> men and women.
>
> There's basically zero chance that there will ever be good sex. I'm sorry to
>
> tell you that.
>
> But there is some good news here. Because what I realize is that this is
>
> actually a
>
> really liberating thing. This could be the key to our happiness. Because you
>
> can come
>
> to an event here tonight, and if you see someone you like, you can go up to
>
> them and say, "I
>
> feel you. Yeah, I know you suck at sex. So do I. Let's go and have bad sex
>
> together."
>
> All right. I'll leave you with that. Thank you. You guys are great. Give it up
>
> for Harry
>
> Fox, everybody! I've got to get on that tram now. I've got to see this ride for
>
> myself.
>
> Tram number three, guys. Okay. Let's bring up...
