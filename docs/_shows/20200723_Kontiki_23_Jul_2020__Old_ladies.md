> Uh, he is actually British, but he's been living here for the past 17 years. He's very funny.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Harry Fox!
>
> What happens after that?
>
> What happens after that?
>
> I'm gonna check, check.
>
> That actually adds, 'cause I was about to say, I am pissed, Kontiki, and now I'm even more pissed.
>
> And I'm the worst kind of pissed right now.
>
> I am pissed with myself.
>
> Because this morning, I had a shaving accident.
>
> And now I look like Charles Sabia and Wolverine had a mutant love child.
>
> It's not good. And it, and it's, I don't even have, I don't have the personality for this beard
>
> style.
>
> You know, I just can't do '70s porn stuff.
>
> And it does, it's a bit reassuring to me that I'm glad it's mainly a male crowd tonight.
>
> A lot of bros here, a bit of a sausage fest.
>
> A few ladies looking a bit nervous, three of them.
>
> And it could be three and a half, I'm not sure what's behind the face mask over there.
>
> I mean, how was this conversation tonight? Was he like, "Oh, can I wear my face mask tonight?"
>
> And you're like, "Oh, do you have to do that?"
>
> And he's like, "I've got a new black one!"
>
> It's a very gimpy situation happening in this area, I feel like.
>
> Yeah, and anyway, so, as Amit said, I've been here a long time.
>
> I have been here a long time.
>
> And in fact, right now I'm in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> Woo!
>
> Thank you.
>
> And when I get my passport, I'm going to be voting S.Y.L.P.
>
> Because it's time to do something about all the immigrants.
>
> And especially, I mean, the English-speaking immigrants.
>
> Because if you look at these guys, what have they done?
>
> They voted for Brexit, they voted for Trump, and then they're like,
>
> "Oh my God, we fucked up our country! Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> But then you've got to ask, what are they actually bringing here?
>
> Because, say, the Vietnamese and the Indians, when they came here, they brought great cuisine.
>
> Or the Romanians and the Brazilians, when they came here, they brought sexual relief.
>
> But these English-speakers, they're just coming here and stealing our comedy jokes.
>
> It's just not okay.
>
> But, yeah.
>
> I mean, have any of you been in Switzerland for more than five years?
>
> Okay, we have probably some Swiss.
>
> You know when you've been here a long time.
>
> Do you know how you can tell that?
>
> Because you have to find stupid things to get annoyed about.
>
> Because, let's face it, it's perfect here.
>
> There is nothing wrong with this country.
>
> Life is fantastic.
>
> So you have to invent things to be angry about.
>
> And for me, it's old ladies at swimming pools.
>
> Because I go swimming in the morning.
>
> This morning, after I'd fucked up my beard, I'm like, "Okay, I'll go to the fly bar, go for a swim."
>
> And always, there's just this row of old ladies swimming in a line up and down the pool.
>
> And go, "La, la, la, la, la, la."
>
> Having a nice gossip, keeping their hair dry.
>
> And then I have to, instead of doing just back and forth, I've got to go around them.
>
> One time I swam underneath.
>
> I'm still in therapy from what I saw.
>
> And I just get really upset.
>
> I'm just like, I want to scream at them.
>
> This is a fly bar. There's literally a cafe just there.
>
> Can you go and move the conversation over there?
>
> Of course, I don't say that.
>
> I did the Swiss correct thing.
>
> At the side of the pool, I left a post-it.
>
> That's how you handle that stuff in Switzerland.
>
> Yeah, but, yeah, I don't know.
>
> I also had a Swiss girlfriend.
>
> Any of you guys had a Swiss girlfriend?
>
> Okay, oh, yeah, oh, this shake of resignation.
>
> I feel you, man.
>
> I mean, I had a Swiss girlfriend for five years.
>
> And, you know, Swiss women, they're very tricky to deal with
>
> because it was only 1991 that women finally got the right to have orgasms.
>
> It's very tricky.
>
> But I did learn, over time, I learned to understand her.
>
> And what I discovered is that Swiss women have some key phrases.
>
> And if any of you guys here know the Swiss girlfriend,
>
> you need to understand this stuff.
>
> So, for example, if she says to you, "Oh, schätzli,"
>
> this is a good thing.
>
> This means that later on there's a high chance of you receiving sexual favors.
>
> But if she says to you, "Schatz,"
>
> you should probably just spend the night on the sofa, basically.
>
> That's how you're going to spend that night.
>
> Or if she says to you, "Hurrigeil," this is very good.
>
> This means she's as horny as a whore.
>
> That is literally what it means, Swiss people.
>
> But if she says to you, "Leck mich doch am Arsch,"
>
> under no circumstances should you try to lick her asshole.
>
> Unless she says to you, "Das ist ein Schiestreck,"
>
> in which case you could try to lick her asshole,
>
> but you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> And that's it for me tonight.
>
> We've just explained Swiss women.
>
> I feel I've made the world a better place.
>
> Have a good night.
>
> What a polite outro.
