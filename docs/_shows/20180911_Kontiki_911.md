> - Harry Fox!
>
> - Yes, so it's actually Harry Fux, it's a German name,
>
> but as you've got a lot of English speakers here,
>
> you will think I'm Harry Fux.
>
> And you probably think I come from a long line of fucks.
>
> Generations of them.
>
> I actually took a DNA test recently,
>
> and it turns out that I'm related to Genghis Khan,
>
> and one of his descendants now.
>
> You probably don't believe this,
>
> but scientists actually recently discovered
>
> that one in 200 men is directly descended from Genghis Khan.
>
> He was a real fucker.
>
> Yeah, so unfortunately, I think Genghis
>
> would be very disappointed in me.
>
> I have not fucked anywhere near enough people
>
> to even qualify to be Harry Fux.
>
> But I am a father, that happens.
>
> I'm a single dad, I have two teenagers.
>
> I call them Howler and Whatler.
>
> And I've always played a big role in my kids' life.
>
> Like, I was there when they were born.
>
> And you may love, you know, just a quick aside,
>
> in the good old days, like, the guys got to go
>
> and get drunk and smoke cigars, drink whiskey.
>
> Now you have to be there, you know,
>
> otherwise, like, women are gonna get really upset.
>
> So I was there with my ex,
>
> and I was kind of behind her, propping her up.
>
> And this whole experience means
>
> that I now know way too much about birth and babies.
>
> Now maybe if I just share a few things here,
>
> you see, while you're there,
>
> looking after your partner, trying to calm her down,
>
> and she's trying to press out your kids,
>
> at a certain point, the nurse is gonna say,
>
> "Oh, you can see the head,
>
> "do you want to come and have a look?"
>
> You know, advice to every guy here,
>
> the correct answer is no.
>
> 'Cause if you go around there,
>
> you're gonna see things that will damage you for life.
>
> The first thing you're gonna see
>
> is that thing that you love most about your partner
>
> just got turned into the Gotthard Tunnel.
>
> If you like the Gotthard Tunnel,
>
> in the future, it's gonna take you a long time
>
> to get in there.
>
> Some guys here have this, they know it well.
>
> Once you're inside, you're gonna find
>
> it's kind of boring and probably sends you to sleep.
>
> And you're just gonna be wishing
>
> that someone would give you access to a second tunnel.
>
> Gotta work this one through.
>
> So, yeah, but that's actually not the worst part
>
> of if you go around there,
>
> because what you may not have realized
>
> is that when a woman is there,
>
> like going, pressing out a baby,
>
> a baby's not the only thing coming out of there.
>
> And in fact, it could be, if you go around there,
>
> the first image of your newborn, your flesh and blood,
>
> is of its head resting on a pile of shit.
>
> Now, for the women here,
>
> don't feel uncomfortable about this.
>
> It's okay.
>
> The nurses will come and wipe your ass for you.
>
> But this is the type of stuff I'm talking about.
>
> I just know too much about this.
>
> In fact, sometimes when I see a group of women,
>
> you know like when you see a group of women and their friends
>
> and one of them's just got a newborn,
>
> and they're like, "Oh, so sweet, so cute.
>
> "I just love the way babies smell."
>
> Now, I hate to break it to you,
>
> but that is not the smell of a baby.
>
> That is the smell of something
>
> that just spent nine months in your friend's vagina.
>
> And the correct thing that you should be saying is,
>
> "Oh, I just love the smell of your pussy."
>
> So, you know, I have these dark thoughts
>
> when I see these happy moments, these baby showers,
>
> because this whole thing has kind of left me
>
> a bit traumatized.
>
> I have a lot of weird thoughts going on in my head.
>
> Recently, I was thinking about,
>
> you know the game Top Trumps?
>
> In German, it's called Quartet.
>
> With the cars, and you compare the cars.
>
> You've got like speed, acceleration, engine size.
>
> And I was just thinking,
>
> well, wouldn't it be interesting to do this with dick pics?
>
> Because you think about it, on the internet,
>
> there's like so many dick pics not being used for anything.
>
> They're just lying around.
>
> Let's make a card game out of this.
>
> And, you know, you could like pick out a card.
>
> You could compare length, obviously, and width.
>
> And you probably have some special cards
>
> that you'd have the micro penis.
>
> And this thing would be scoring 99 out of 100
>
> for social anxiety.
>
> So these guys could finally get to win something.
>
> Or you might have like the racer,
>
> which is like from zero to orgasm in less than 10 seconds.
>
> Probably the Trump card, the card that beats everything,
>
> is just simply two flaccid penises lying on the ground
>
> that no one can erect.
>
> It's gonna be called the 9/11, of course.
>
> I think I just want it to end tonight on a 9/11 joke,
>
> so I think I'm done here.
>
> You guys have been great.
>
> Good night.
