> We're off tonight. Before that, I have to tell you guys something about the
>
> donation box.
>
> We really appreciate you guys giving us anything. We really will accept
>
> anything.
>
> Except, uh, maybe not a lemon, okay? So please keep it simple. I'll give this
>
> to you.
>
> You deserve a lemon tonight. Um, okay, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Are you guys ready for your last performer of tonight?
>
> Also, after the show, Michelle will be at the door if the box missed you.
>
> But now, it's time for the last performer of tonight.
>
> This guy is very funny. He's originally from the UK, but he's been living here
>
> for a very long time.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> Thank you!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> It's spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But for Joe the American at the back, you think it's Harry Fucks, don't it?
>
> That's a better name.
>
> My name is not Harry Fucks, then.
>
> And, you know, in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very
>
> upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halber and Watber.
>
> But, you know, the real problem with the name, like, Harry Fucks, is it sets a
>
> very high level of expectation.
>
> And, honestly, there's only been about this much fucking.
>
> Okay, honestly, there's not much fucking.
>
> But, and, you know, and recently this has actually been starting to worry me.
>
> Because the thought occurred to me recently, how do I know, actually, if I'm
>
> any good at sex?
>
> Because I read a thing recently, it said, to be good at anything, it takes 10,000
>
> hours.
>
> That's right, 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking.
>
> If I add it all up, if I add it all up, probably I get to about 5,000.
>
> If I include masturbation.
>
> I think you understand this, don't you?
>
> I think you understand this, don't you?
>

>
> I think you understand this, don't you?
>
> You know, to me, this is a really depressing thought, you know, because when I
>
> come here
>
> on a night like this, and I see all of you wasting time listening to me, I know
>
> that
>
> all of you must suck at sex, too.
>
> Just wasting time in here, because, you know, if you fuck for 24 hours for an
>
> entire year,
>
> you're only at 8,000 hours.
>
> You may have done the maths on this.
>
> If you live to sex, you're only at 8,000 hours.
>

> If you take a number three tram, it's going to stop at places that will blow
>
> your mind.
>
> Because first of all, it's going to stop outside Sensuel.
>
> Now, Sensuel is a sex shop for women.
>
> It's full of feathers and aromas and sexy underwear and erotic literature.
>
> Because for women, a lot about what makes sex enjoyable is what's going on in
>
> their head.
>
> In their head.
>
> Which I think means I need to put my...
>
> What do you mean now?
>
> With this, you just ruined my joke about putting my dick in your mouth.
>
> Fuck you.
>
> Point to me at the end.
>
> I'm not talking about it so much.
>
> God damn it.
>
> This is a patisserie common bath.
>
> Whatever.
>
> Okay, so...
>
> You know, so...
>
> Let's get the crowd focus again.
>
> So...
>
> Let's...
>
> Let's...
>
> Let's get back on our tram through Zurich.
>
> Are you with me on the number three tram through Zurich?
>
> Thank you.
>
> And someone gag her, please.
>
> Bondage girls, do you have something for her?
>
> Alright, back on the tram.
>
> You're cruising through Zurich.
>
> And you're going to come to another sex shop.
>
> A sex shop for men.
>
> Called the Erotic Factory.
>
> Because for men, nothing is more erotic than a factory.
>
> It's full of underpaid workers in a first world country.
>
> It's a very sexy thing.
>
> And you can get it in the names.
>
> You know, like Erotic Factory, men, sensual, women.
>
> This thing is never really going to work, is it?
>
> But that's when I realized, you know, this is actually the key to our happiness.
>
> Because, you know, you could come to a night like tonight, like Sweaty here.
>
> And you see someone you like, like Chris.
>
> And Sweaty...
>
> Sorry, that's Sweaty.
>
> I don't know who I am.
>
> Sorry, it's a lot of hair.
>
> I just have hair.
>
> Okay, Sweaty, you came here.
>
> You saw Chris, the intern.
>
> You thought, hmm, can I get you a coffee?
>
> Some of that special coffee.
>
> But, you know, what are you going to do?
>
> It's really simple.
>
> Because as you both suck at sex, you can just say, Chris, I feel you, man.
>
> I feel you, baby, Chris.
>
> You suck at sex, so do I.
>
> Let's have bad sex together.
>
> Or the coffee.
>
> Do we have some more time?
>
> One minute.
>
> One minute.
>
> Okay, I'm going to cram it one fast minute.
>
> You know, this...
>
> Which is probably going to last about four minutes.
>
> So, you know, I wonder about this stuff, actually.
>
> I think about, you know, gender issues a lot.
>
> Because I'm actually a single dad.
>
> I have a teenage daughter.
>
> And being a single dad with a teenage daughter, it's hard.
>
> Because, you know, you're being...
>
> You're being confronted with things you're just completely unprepared for.
>
> Like recently, you know.
>
> I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom.
>
> And, oh, my God.
>
> It looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror.
>
> Drops of blood in the sink.
>
> Drops of blood on the floor.
>
> And the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming.
>
> And I looked around.
>
> And I realized the screaming was coming.
>
> It was coming from me.
>
> But at that moment, to rescue me, my daughter came up.
>
> And she said, hey, Dad, I got my period.
>
> Yeah, so after cleaning out my daughter's menstrual blood,
>
> I was like, hey, can I get you something?
>
> And she said, Dad, get me tampons.
>
> Now, obviously, this is a job I'm completely unqualified for.
>
> But I thought, this can't be so hard.
>
> So I went over.
>
> I went to Amigro.
>
> And I took a look around.
>
> And what I found is that tampon product names are no use whatsoever
>
> when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like OB Pro.
>
> This is like for professional women that bleed for a living.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> Like glow-in-the-dark tampons.
>
> And the lights are off just so you can climb in there.
>
> The one I liked the most was...
>
> was Always Infinity.
>
> Because that's for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But that's obviously not my daughter.
>
> In fact, what I ended up getting for my daughter
>
> was another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It is amazing.
>
> It's fantastic.
>
> Wait, wait.
>
> The story continues.
>
> Wait one second.
>
> Bring the claps after.
>
> Because...
>
> Because...
>
> What this tampon does is around about 10 o'clock it starts leaking.
>
> And she's always home by eleven.
>
> And for me, you know, it made me a very proud father.
>
> It's not often you're this proud as a father.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in
>
> her vagina.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in
>
> her vagina.
