> That was pretty good, pretty solid, now I know you don't care, but I'm Turkish
>
> and I don't think you're cool here.
>
> Let's bring up our next comedian everybody, I love this guy, he's originally
>
> from the UK guys, he's from the UK.
>
> He's done our mic a couple times before, he's very funny. Give it up for Harry
>
> Fox everybody!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs, it's a German name, I spell it F-U-C-K-S, I
>
> repeat F-U-C-K-S.
>
> Of course when I'm with English speakers a lot of you think my name is Harry
>
> Fox, my name is not Harry Fox.
>
> The problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation, and I'm right about here on the talking stand, I'm afraid.
>
> This is actually something that makes me feel a little bit insecure, because
>
> after all this time I've been on this planet I still don't know if I'm any good
>
> at sex.
>
> Because I read recently that to be good at anything you need to do it for 10,000
>
> hours.
>
> 10,000 hours is a lot of fucking, seriously if I try to add up all the fucking
>
> I've done, maybe throw in the masturbation and the pornography, I'm probably
>
> only at about 5,000 hours.
>
> Maybe it was 6,000 with the porn, I don't know, but the thing is I find this
>
> kind of very depressing because I know that I'm never maybe ever going to
>
> attain the idea that I'd be good at sex.
>
> But what's even more depressing to me is that right here, right now in this
>
> room, you all suck at sex too.
>
> This is a terrible thing, you know, and the worst part about it is that instead
>
> of doing something about it you're just sat here listening to me.
>
> You need to act now, because if you are fucking for 24 hours a day for an
>
> entire year you're only at about 8,000 hours.
>
> I've done the maths, I've thought this through, because also if you live for 70
>
> years you need to have sex 11 times a day from the day you were born to the day
>
> you die.
>
> And I don't know what's worse about that, the idea of newborn babies fucking or
>
> sex with old people on the day they're dying.
>
> I'm sorry, please cover your mum's ears, it's me ruining a birthday party.
>
> But you know, I know some of you though, some of you are like, this is bullshit,
>
> this is bullshit, I know I'm good at sex, Peter for example, look he's got all
>
> these women following him around, some of them he even made them, I'm good at
>
> sex.
>
> Only two people are good at sex Peter, prostitutes and compulsive liars.
>
> You need to stop lying, you're clearly a hoe.
>
> So I think what makes this stuff hard is that men and women, we don't really
>
> understand what the opposite sex enjoys.
>
> And you know, I encountered this recently, I was on a date with a girl, we
>
> ended up in bed and she couldn't even tell me where her own clitoris was, her
>
> own clitoris.
>
> Maybe I forgot to remove the gag, I can't remember.
>
> But we're getting some hushes at Dallas, it's quite tough, I'm going to leave
>
> this place with the trauma.
>
> She's a psychologist, she can help you after the show.
>
> But you know, actually I think I found a solution to this, it's actually a very
>
> easy solution so that men and women can understand each other better.
>
> All you've got to do is take a number three tram through Zurich.
>
> If you take a number three tram through Zurich, the first place it's going to
>
> stop is outside Sensuelle.
>
> Sensuelle is a sex shop for women.
>
> And if you go to Sensuelle, Sensuelle is actually near the Zielpost at the harbour,
>
> let me just do a bit of geography here.
>
> If you need to go there, that's the place.
>
> And if you go in Sensuelle, it's a sex shop for women, you'll find it's full of
>
> feathers and aromas and sexy underwear and erotic books.
>
> Because for women, a big part of sex is what's going on in their mind, not just
>
> their body.
>
> What's going on in their head.
>
> Does this mean that I just need to make sure I have my dick in her mouth?
>
> I don't know.
>
> Okay, a few giggles there. That was a really fucking uncalled joke.
>
> Me too. Can someone call me too here?
>
> But if you get back on the tram, let's get back on the tram quickly and get the
>
> hell out of there.
>
> And go on a little bit, you'll find that eventually it's going to stop outside
>
> the erotic factory.
>
> And of course, men find nothing more erotic than a factory.
>
> Full of underpaid workers in a third world country.
>
> And actually, just the name. Just the name, ladies, tells you everything you
>
> need to know about men's sexuality.
>
> They would find a factory erotic. The whole story is there.
>
> And so between Sensuelle, so sensitive, and the erotic factory, we are worlds
>
> apart.
>
> We will never, ever reach a point of good sex.
>
> But then I realized that this doesn't have to be a depressing thing.
>
> This might actually be amazing. This might be the liberating thing.
>
> The secret to our happiness.
>
> Because you can come to a place like that.
>
> And if you see, like here tonight, if you see someone you like, you can go,
>
> "Yeah, I feel you. I know, I know, I know you suck at sex. So do I. Let's go
>
> and have bad sex together."
>
> Alright, that's what I'm getting the hell out of you tonight. Thank you. Thank
>
> you for the gift.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fox, everybody!
>
> He proved tonight he definitely doesn't.
>
> Wow, our acts are getting dirtier and balder, somehow.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we do have one last comedian left in our first half.
>
> I know, right?
>
> Awww.
>
> Do it harder!
>
> Aww, don't worry, guys. We've got more comedy in the second half.
>
> But I am going to bring up our last comedian of this half.
>
> This guy is amazing. He's originally, actually, he's American, but he now lives
>
> in Geneva.
>
> Okay, so the French part of Switzerland, people over there, keep your eyes open.
>
> Exactly, sir.
>
> So, I want you guys to give him a big, Zurich warm welcome.
>
> Here he is, everybody! Robbie Toole!
>
> Hi, everyone.
>
> Hello.
>
> So, I think I'm like the condensed version of Toole.
>
> I don't know if you can all hear me.
>
> I have a very strange body type. There's not a lot of people shaped like this
>
> here.
>
> And I know that from when I go clothes shopping.
>
> Because, like, there's only two versions of shirts that I can buy.
>
> They're either crop tops or cocktail dresses.
>
> That's all I've got.
>
> And I went shopping once.
>
> And I was like, "I'm so sorry. You're probably not going to find this shirt."
>
> Every jazz wants to have their calves.
>
> I guess, but no guy wants to be shaped like a calf.
>
> I have the same length, width, and height.
>
> Like, when I come up with my measurements, I just go, "Seven."
>
> Cute.
>
> And when I was in school, I had some of my teachers talk geometry.
>
> They're like, "Robbie, can you stand up?"
>
> And I'm just, "Robbie has a cute and tall..."
>
> You can't even tell if I'm standing up or lying down.
>
> I think I saw the most Swiss thing I've ever seen before.
>
> I was walking down the street, and I saw this old man start to cross.
>
> And he got a third of the way there.
>
> And then the great van turned into a red van.
>
> So he just turned around and went back.
>
> But he couldn't make it in time, so a car drove right up to him and honked at
>
> him.
>
> Like, wow.
>
> It was in that moment that I realized why the Swiss are neutral.
>
> Because when people stopped following rules in war, they wouldn't win.
>
> Can you imagine a Swiss general going, "All right, everybody, let's go! Let's
>
> charge!"
>
> Oh, wait. They're not ready. They're not ready.
>
> Go back. Go back.
>
> Let's wait for them to shoot first, just to make sure.
>
> Wait for the green man.
>
> So I, here, have a pregnant wife.
>
> For the third time.
>
> I usually just get two reactions. I don't get three reactions. I get two.
>
> The first one is, "Oh, so you're living your life that way."
>
> And then the other one is, "What's wrong with you?"
>
> "Freeze!"
>
> And, like, I haven't even told my mom yet.
>
> Like, I'd rather just tell people I don't care about them.
>
> But when I talk to my mom on the phone, I think she can tell something wrong.
>
> She's like, "Are we officially going to tell me?"
>
> Like, I can't. Not yet.
>
> And then I remember I walked into the gym one day, and the guy was like,
>
> "Hey, man, how's it going?"
>
> "My wife's pregnant."
>
> You have to tell somebody.
>
> Oh, boy.
>
> But I'm glad my kids are growing up.
>
> I have two little kids right now.
>
> And I'm glad they're growing up Swiss, because I think they're going to learn.
>
> Anybody Swiss here? I know Michelle.
>
> We have a couple of Swiss people.
>
> I think you guys are lucky, because you understand how to be risk-averse.
>
> When you're growing up, like, I've seen this on the playground.
>
> You can tell who the Swiss parents are,
>
> because they're just sitting on the bench,
>
> sipping on their--well, in Geneva, they sip on their rompers,
>
> they just kind of hang out,
>
> while the American parents are just chasing their kids around.
>
> That's because we know our kids don't have that same sense of danger.
>
> Like, I kid you not, I saw this.
>
> This kid walks up to the slide, definitely just this kid.
>
> He gets to the edge, and he realizes the slide's too big for him.
>
> So he turns around and he slides down feet first.
>
> And he just floats down like a feather.
>
> And then my son was right behind him, and he was like,
>
> "Oh, so you can go down the slide in different ways."
>
> So he just went head first, straight off the slide.
>
> And then I have a one-year-old daughter,
>
> and she's just walking around the playground having a good time,
>
> and she saw a zipline, like a kid kind of flying on a zipline.
>
> She was like, "Oh, that looks fun. I'm going to go right at it."
>
> So my daughter just starts walking, walking, walking.
>
> Boom! The six-year-old just takes her right out.
>
> But luckily, he was a Swiss six-year-old,
>
> so he explained to her that it was her fault.
>
> I think people in the U.S. have a big geography problem.
>
> Like, a lot of my friends from back home, they'll send me messages.
>
> They're like, "Hey, I'm coming to Europe in two weeks.
>
> Want to meet up?"
>
> Or, "Are you going to downtown Europe or midtown Europe?"
>
> My mother-in-law came to visit Shiva, so very multicultural there.
>
> So that's a problem.
>
> She had this choir singing, and it was a bunch of people from Ghana, Nigeria,
>
> and Kenya.
>
> So to America, Africa.
>
> And she turns to us and goes, "Wow, that African-American, African choir."
>
> It would be like one of them turning and going,
>
> "Wow, that white, Anglo-Saxon woman is really rude."
