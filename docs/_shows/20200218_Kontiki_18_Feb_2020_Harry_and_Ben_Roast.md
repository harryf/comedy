> Gareth Pinto, ladies and gentlemen. So, we only have one last act, then it's
>
> time to take a break.
>
> Let's go out and drink a little bit. Am I right? Am I right? Let's smoke. No.
>
> Let's bring up this last act, ladies and gentlemen. Give it up. It's Harry Fox,
>
> ladies and gentlemen.
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fox. It's a German name. Spell F-U-C-K-S. I
>
> repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox. And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them how-the and what-the, just to give them
>
> a good start in life.
>
> But the real problem with the name Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> And honestly, there's only really been about this. Okay, honestly, it's not
>
> much.
>
> And part of the reason for that, I think, is because I'm a single dad, you know,
>
> and I have two teenage kids.
>
> They live with me. And living with teenagers, it's like living in a student big
>
> in a flat share.
>
> Because there's never any milk. It's always a fucking mess. But I have to pay
>
> for everything.
>
> It is the shittest flat share ever.
>
> But on the good news side is that tonight, I get to get some revenge.
>
> Because Ben, my teenage son, is here. Ben, I challenge you to a comedy roast.
>
> Get up here, Ben. Bring it up here.
>
> Give it up for Ben.
>
> Wow.
>
> Common, do you approve of this form of family communication?
>
> Okay, she's still thinking about it.
>
> You can judge at the end.
>
> All right, so, here's what we're going to do.
>
> How is this for you, Ben? Is this the most awkward thing I've done for you?
>
> Yeah, kind of.
>
> All right, so we're going to increase the awkwardness with three jokes.
>
> So, and then we're going to do that.
>
> And then at the end, you guys get to decide that I won because of my comedic
>
> genius.
>
> Okay, that's the rules of this thing.
>
> All right, so, round one.
>
> Exactly.
>
> Round one. All right, so I'm going to start.
>
> You know, I feel kind of sorry for Ben because when I was a kid, you know, we
>
> didn't worry about how our bodies looked.
>
> But now Instagram and Ben, he suffers from negative body image.
>
> Because he kind of has some man boobs.
>
> And the left boob is bigger than the right.
>
> Wow.
>
> Okay, I would expect a better response now.
>
> Okay, Ben, over to you.
>
> So, you know that feeling when you're walking home, it's dark and there's a
>
> creepy guy following you?
>
> You look back, and it's your dad.
>
> He is a creepy motherfucker.
>
> Wow.
>
> Holy shit.
>
> All right, then we're going to go.
>
> I don't like where this is progressing right now.
>
> Okay, so we're going to go in a different direction.
>
> Ben's love life.
>
> Because, you know, Ben is having a bit of a problem with the ladies.
>
> Because he's already been rejected over 50 times by the same girl.
>
> All right, come back to that.
>
> So, my dad is dating at the moment.
>
> And I get really stressed when he brings a date.
>
> You know, I worry about the future.
>
> Am I going to be in an episode of My Two Dads?
>
> What the fuck?
>
> That was an inappropriate joke.
>
> Jesus.
>
> All right, all right, damn.
>
> Okay, we're going to go.
>
> This is it.
>
> I'm going to...
>
> Ben, you've asked for this.
>
> You've pushed it this far.
>
> We're now going all in.
>
> Because recently, something terrible happened.
>
> Recently, I caught Ben watching porn.
>
> Luckily, I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> I could point him at all the first categories.
>
> All right, motherfucker.
>
> You know what's worse than getting caught watching porn?
>
> It's catching your dad watching porn.
>
> Especially if it's fucking MILF porn.
>
> Gross.
>
> Gross.
>
> All right.
>
> So...
>
> Okay, so now we just come...
>
> And what did you think of this?
>
> Was this a...
>
> Was I patient?
>
> Did I listen to him?
>
> Okay, fantastic.
>
> We have approval.
>
> Official approval.
>
> All right.
>
> So, let's decide this by your cheers.
>
> Give it up for me.
>
> If you thought I was fantastic.
>
> Fantastic.
>
> All right, all right.
>
> I like this.
>
> Fuck it.
>
> Jesus Christ.
>
> Getting out of control a bit.
>
> All right, all right.
>
> Give it up to this useless teenager.
>
> What the fuck?
>
> Get back there.
>
> Go do some homework.
>
> Wow.
>
> Jesus.
>
> Well, you know, I'm just going to say this.
>
> I'm just going to say that at least I'm not a helicopter parent like Kobe
>
> Bryant.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I didn't land that joke.
>
> So, I'm going to get out of here before this show crashes.
>
> Thank you, guys.
>
> Give it up for Ben.
>
> Wow.
>
> That was fun.
