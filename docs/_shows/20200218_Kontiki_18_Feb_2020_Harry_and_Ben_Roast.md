<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Gareth Pinto, ladies and gentlemen. So, we only have one last act and it's time to take a break.
>
> Let's go out and drink a little bit, am I right? Am I right? Let's smoke. No.
>
> Let's bring up this last act, ladies and gentlemen. Give it up. It's Harry Fox, ladies and
>
> gentlemen.
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fooks. It's a German name. Spell F-O-O-C-K-S. I repeat, F-O-O-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halver and Wather just to give them a good starting line.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And honestly, there's only really been about this, okay, honestly, there's that much.
>
> And part of the reason for that, I think, is because I'm a single dad, you know, and I have two
>
> teenage kids.
>
> They live with me. And living with teenagers, it's like living in a student baguette, a flat share.
>
> Because there's never any milk. It's always a fucking mess. But I have to pay for everything.
>
> It is the shittest flat share ever.
>
> But, on the good news side, is that tonight, I get to get some revenge.
>
> Because Ben, my teenage son, is here. Ben, I challenge you to a comedy roast.
>
> Get up here, Ben. Bring it up here.
>
> Give it up for Ben. Wow.
>
> Carmen, do you approve of this form of family communication?
>
> Okay, she's still thinking about it. You can judge at the end.
>
> Alright, so, here's what we're going to do.
>
> How is this for you, Ben? Is this the most awkward thing I've done for you?
>
> Yeah, kind of.
>
> Alright, so we're going to increase the awkwardness with three jokes.
>
> So, and then we're going to do that, and then at the end, you guys get to decide that I won because
>
> of my comedic genius.
>
> Okay, that's the rules of this thing.
>
> Alright, so round one, exactly. Round one. Alright, so I'm going to start.
>
> You know, I feel kind of sorry for Ben, because when I was a kid, you know, we didn't worry about
>
> how our bodies looked.
>
> We're now on Instagram, and Ben, he suffers from negative body image.
>
> Because he kind of has some man boobs, and the left boob is bigger than the right.
>
> Wow.
>
> Yeah, I would expect a better response now. Okay, Ben, over to you.
>
> So, you know that feeling when you're walking home, it's dark and there's a creepy guy following
>
> you?
>
> You look back, and it's your dad.
>
> He is a creepy motherfucker.
>
> Fuck.
>
> Holy shit. Alright, then we're going to go, we're going to, I don't like where this is progressing.
>
> Okay, so we're going to go in a different direction. Ben's love life.
>
> Because, you know, Ben is having a bit of a problem with the ladies, because he's already been
>
> rejected over 50 times by the same girl.
>
> Alright, come back to that.
>
> So, my dad is dating at the moment, and I get really stressed when he brings a date home.
>
> You know, I worry about the future. Am I going to be in an episode of My Two Dads?
>
> That was an inappropriate joke. Jesus.
>
> Alright, alright, damn. Okay, we're going to go, this is it. I'm going to, Ben, you've asked for
>
> this, you've pushed it this far.
>
> We're now going all in, because recently, something terrible happened.
>
> Recently, I caught Ben watching porn.
>
> Luckily, I'm a bit of an expert. I can point him at all of those categories.
>
> Alright, motherfucker.
>
> You know what's worse than getting caught watching porn?
>
> It's catching your dad watching porn.
>
> Especially if it's fucking MILF porn.
>
> Gross.
>
> Alright, so, okay, so now we've just come, and what did you think of this?
>
> Was I patient? Did I listen to him?
>
> Okay, fantastic, we have approval, official approval.
>
> Alright, so let's decide this by your cheers. Give it up for me if you thought I was fantastic.
>
> Alright, alright, I like this.
>
> Fuck it, Jesus Christ.
>
> Alright, alright, give it up to this useless teenager.
>
> What the fuck?
>
> Get back there, go do some homework, wow.
>
> Jesus.
>
> Well, you know, I'm just going to say this, I'm just going to say that at least I'm not a
>
> helicopter parent like Kobe Bryant.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> I'm sorry, it didn't land, that joke.
>
> So I'm going to get out of here before this show crashes.
>
> Thank you guys.
>
> Give it up for Ben.
>
> Wow.
