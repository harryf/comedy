> I think you guys will enjoy me. Here he is everybody. Harry Fox! Bring him up
>
> on stage!
>
> Yeah, so, uh, my name is actually not Harry Fox. It's Harry Fuchs. It's a
>
> German name.
>
> Actually, I get a bit upset by all you English speakers calling me Harry Fuchs.
>
> When, uh, my family has, like, a family get-together, we get very upset if you
>
> call us a group of fuckers.
>
> Because clearly we would be a pack of fucks.
>
> But, uh, I've made some mistakes because of this name. For example, I had twins,
>
> and, uh, I called them Hal-the and Wat-the.
>
> I think, uh, I may have damaged them for life. I don't know.
>
> But the hard part about being Harry Fox is it's hard to live up to this, you
>
> know.
>
> It's hard to meet the expectations that people are going to naturally have.
>
> In fact, actually, to be completely open with you, it's been a long time since
>
> I've had any sex.
>
> Um, hands up if you also haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> I didn't realize I was coming to this. You're an infomaniac, so...
>
> So, to help you understand a little bit my condition, where I am, when you
>
> haven't had sex in a long time, you start to see things differently.
>
> It's almost like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be, like, walking down the street. You see a couple of dogs. Sniffing
>
> each other's asses.
>
> When you look at them, you think, uh, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or, uh, you know, you may be a negro in the fruit section, and you spot a
>
> watermelon.
>
> You put one hand on that watermelon, maybe you get two hands on there, and bam,
>
> you're in a new space. You're just there with that watermelon.
>
> And you're kind of, uh, you're oblivious to everyone around you. You're
>
> completely forgotten. This is "migro."
>
> And suddenly, you hear, "Junge Mann, schämen Sie sich nicht?"
>
> And you look, and there's this old lady about to hit you with a hammer. And you
>
> think, uh, "She's nice."
>
> But yeah, it hasn't actually all been going so badly. Uh, recently, I had a,
>
> let's say, a close encounter, thanks to Tinder.
>
> Uh, I went on a date with the lady. It went very well.
>
> We went back to her place. One thing led to another.
>
> And, uh, you know, just to help you visualize, I was kind of going down, and I
>
> was kind of wrapped around all her breasts and was kissing her stomach.
>
> And I pulled her panties down and found a cluster of diamonds.
>
> And I said, "Hey, what do these diamonds do to me?"
>
> And it turned out that actually this lady was bejazzled.
>
> Now, you may not know what bejazzling is.
>
> Bejazzling actually was invented in the year 2012 by Beyonce.
>
> And it's the act of when a woman has shaved her pubic mound to look like a 10-year-old.
>
> It's then to stick some gemstones on there, like some emeralds, some rubies,
>
> some diamonds.
>
> And then the word bejazzle means vagina and dazzle.
>
> So, as a guy pulls down her pants and the light strikes those gemstones, you
>
> are dazzled.
>
> Unfortunately, I was not dazzled.
>
> Because I said, "Listen, I'm sorry, but this is over right now."
>
> These are blood diamonds.
>
> Unfortunately, the beer's mining company had incredible human suffering across.
>
> They can't do this.
>
> And that, unfortunately, was the end of the evening.
>
> But it did get me thinking, like, for you ladies, what kind of things could you
>
> stick above your vagina that would encourage a man to go down on you?
>
> And, you know, like hipsters, for example, they have these beards.
>
> Maybe if you grew or something.
>
> A well-groomed beard.
>
> A bit of beard oil up there.
>
> You know, when he gets down, he'd be like, "Whoa, you're broke."
>
> Or, you know, a lot of guys are into gaming these days.
>
> And, you know, maybe you could get an old Game Boy, take the screen out, stick
>
> it on there.
>
> And as the guy goes down there, he sees, like, Turtleneck 54, 3 minutes and 21
>
> seconds.
>
> Both are built at 2 minutes 45.
>
> A-A-A-A-A, 1 minute 13.
>
> And, you know, like, high scores are gonna totally motivate this guy.
>
> In fact, you could also incentivize him with, like, Achievement Unlocked, Clitoris
>
> Hound.
>
> Or, you know, it's just going badly if you're not enjoying yourself.
>
> Game over, man.
>
> No more discussion.
>
> But, I mean, I guess, okay, hipsters, gamers, you know, most guys may be not
>
> into this if you've just picked up some guy at a bar and he's been drinking.
>
> Well, what kind of things do guys really like?
>
> After a night of drinking beers?
>
> That's right.
>
> You should get a few strips of kebab meat and stick them in there.
>
> And as he goes down there, fix him something to munch on.
>
> And if he asks you any questions, you can just say, "Hey, you've been kebazzled."
>
> All right, I'm done.
