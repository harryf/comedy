<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> I think you guys will enjoy it, but here he is everybody, Harry Fox, bring him up on stage!
>
> Yeah, so my name is actually not Harry Fox, it's Harry Fooks, it's a German name.
>
> Actually I get a bit upset by all you English speakers calling me Harry Fox.
>
> When my family has like a family get-together, we get very upset if you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> Because clearly we would be a pack of fucks.
>
> But I've made some mistakes because of this name.
>
> For example, I have twins and I call them Halba and Watba.
>
> I think I may have damaged their life, I don't know.
>
> The hard part about being Harry Fox is it's hard to live up to this, you know.
>
> It's hard to meet the expectations that people are going to naturally have.
>
> In fact, actually, to be completely open with you, it's been a long time since I've had any sex.
>
> Hands up if you also haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> I didn't realise I was coming to the serial nymphomaniacs.
>
> So to help you understand a little bit my condition where I am.
>
> When you haven't had sex in a long time, you start to see things differently.
>
> It's almost like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be like walking down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or, you know, you may be a negro in the fruit section and you spot a watermelon.
>
> And you put one hand on that watermelon, maybe you get two hands on there.
>
> And bam, you're in a new space, you're just there with that watermelon.
>
> You're oblivious to everyone around you, you completely forget, "Oh, this is me, girl."
>
> And suddenly you hear, "Junge man, schämt es dich nicht?"
>
> And you look and there's this old lady about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, "Uh, she's nice."
>
> But yeah, it hasn't actually all been going so badly.
>
> Recently I had, let's say, a close encounter thanks to Tinder.
>
> I went on a date with the lady, it went very well.
>
> We went back to her place, one thing led to another.
>
> And, you know, just to help you visualize, I was kind of going down,
>
> and I was kind of, like, tumbling her breasts and was kissing her stomach.
>
> And I pulled her panties down and found a cluster of diamonds.
>
> And I said, "Hey, what are these diamonds doing here?"
>
> And it turned out that actually this lady was bejazzled.
>
> Now, you may not know what bejazzling is,
>
> but bejazzling actually was invented in the year 2012 by Beyonce.
>
> And it's the act of when a woman has shaped her pubic mound to look like a ten-year-old.
>
> It's then to stick some gemstones on there, like some emeralds, some rubies, some diamonds.
>
> And then the word bejazzle means vagina and dazzle.
>
> So, as a guy pulls down the pants and the light strikes those gemstones, you are dazzled.
>
> Unfortunately, I was not dazzled. Not at all.
>
> Because I said, "Listen, I'm sorry, but this is over right now.
>
> These are blood diamonds.
>
> You put them in the biggest mining company at incredible human suffering and cost.
>
> You can't do this."
>
> And that, unfortunately, was the end of the evening.
>
> But it did get me thinking, like, for you ladies,
>
> what kind of things could you stick above your vagina that would encourage a man to go down on you?
>
> And, you know, like, hipsters, for example, they have these beards.
>
> Maybe if you grew a well-groomed beard, there's a bit of beard oil up there.
>
> You know, when it gets down, you'd be like, "Whoa, you're broke."
>
> Or, you know, a lot of guys are into gaming these days.
>
> And, you know, maybe you could get an old Gameboy, take the screen out, stick it on there.
>
> And as the guy goes down there, he sees, like, a turtleneck 54, three minutes and 21 seconds.
>
> Bob the Builder, two minutes and 45.
>
> A-A-A-A-A, one minute 13.
>
> And, you know, like, high scores are going to totally motivate this guy.
>
> In fact, you could also incentivize him with, like, an achievement-unlocked clitoris hound.
>
> Or, you know, if it's just going badly, if you're not enjoying yourself, game over, man.
>
> There's no more discussion.
>
> But, I mean, I guess, okay, hipsters, gamers, you know, most guys may be not into this
>
> if you've just picked up some guy at a bar and he's been drinking.
>
> Well, what kind of things do guys really like after a night of drinking beards?
>
> That's right, you should get a few strips of kebab meat and stick them on.
>
> And as he goes down, you know, fixing something to munch on.
>
> And if he asks you any questions, you can just say, "Hey, you've been kabazzled."
>
> All right, I'm done.
