<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> And this guy, he actually lives in Zurich with the rest of our crew, but he is originally British
>
> and he's been living here in Switzerland for about 17 years.
>
> He's very funny. So ladies and gentlemen, our last comic of the first half, give it up for Harry
>
> Fox, ladies and gentlemen!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fooks. It's a German name. Spelled F-O-O-C-K-S. I repeat, F-O-O-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room of mostly English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry
>
> Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halber and Walper, just to give them a good start in life.
>
> But, no, one of the problems with a name like Harry Fox is I get a lot of stupid comments.
>
> Like recently this American tourist came up to me and he's like, "Yo, Harry Fox! Harry Fox what,
>
> man?"
>
> And I was like, "What?"
>
> He's like, "Exactly, Harry Fox what, man?"
>
> I'm like, "Alright, let me see if I can throw him off with some adverts. Harry Fox hopefully. Harry
>
> Fox occasionally. Harry Fox enthusiastically."
>
> And he had no comeback to that. Americans are not that bright.
>
> Any Americans here?
>
> Yes?
>
> Have we had an offended American?
>
> Yeah, oh my god. I hope not. I'm feeling...
>
> Okay, let's get back to the set quickly and move on fast.
>
> No, honestly, actually, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is there simply hasn't been
>
> enough fucking.
>
> In fact, recently, because of lockdown and other things, if I can share this with you, it's
>
> actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Ah, okay. I'm a little bit concerned that you guys haven't respected social distancing.
>
> I'm very impressed by this guy. It's just this woman moved in, started smoking cigars, and he was
>
> like, "Fill up my flat with cigar smoke. I'm cool with that."
>
> But okay, so I hadn't realized that I was coming to the Basel Nymphomaniacs Anonymous meetup.
>
> So I guess I'm going to have to explain a little bit my condition, because when you haven't had sex
>
> in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street and you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses,
>
> and you look at them and think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into micro, you go into micro, you spot an ACCIONA on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two. Bang! It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon. It's getting hot. It's getting steamy. You're oblivious to all
>
> the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this, "You're a man shaming this ACTION!"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag, and you think, "She's nice."
>
> Yeah, so that's how that's been going.
>
> During lockdown, I was very locked down, very horny. My stupid brain gave me a stupid idea.
>
> It said, "Hey, why don't you give Tinder a try?"
>
> Now, for you guys, except for the front row here, for the 20s and 30-year-olds in the audience, for
>
> you guys, Tinder is an amazing place.
>
> Because you get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies and potential erotic encounters.
>
> And the dream that your prince, your perfect match, might somehow be in this app.
>
> But for me, I have to deal with older Tinder. And older Tinder is a dark place.
>
> I have to swipe my way through broken marriages, drug and alcohol problems, faded tattoos saying, "No
>
> regrets!"
>
> It's brutal. And the scariest thing, the scariest thing on older Tinder is the sight of a 50-year-old
>
> woman making a duck face.
>
> I mean, how the fuck do you get to be 50 and think that a duck face is okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is ever okay is when both your parents are ducks.
>
> And actually, ducks only live about 10 years. The universe has no place for a 50-year-old duck face.
>
> That shouldn't be happening.
>
> But maybe even worse than all the swiping is actually on that rare occasion, you end up with a
>
> Tinder date and all the Tinder dates.
>
> And you go along and you're all kind of chirpy and happy and then you meet.
>
> And the conversation inevitably goes like, "Yeah, I fucked up the last 40 years of my life, but for
>
> some insane reason, I just think it's getting better from here."
>
> And then she's like, "Oh, I too fucked up my entire life." And you go, "Wow, we have something
>
> massively depressing in common. This is great."
>
> "Hey, do you want to come back to my place and then we can just kill ourselves? That would be the
>
> perfect end to this date."
>
> It's brutal. And I just thought about this and I'm like, "I hate this app."
>
> So I finally thought, "That's it. I'm going to delete it."
>
> And just as I was going to delete the app, I got a message from this lady. It said, "With those
>
> cute blue eyes, how is it you're still running around free?"
>
> Now, aside from that being the worst pickup line ever, can you imagine if I was to say that to any
>
> woman here?
>
> Like, "You shouldn't be running around free. You should be tied up in my dungeon."
>
> That is fucking insane. That is an insane thing to say to anyone.
>
> And what it made me realize, it made me realize that actually maybe all the ladies have a bit of a
>
> problem that they don't really know how to chat up men.
>
> Because for all these years, guys have been doing all the work. We've been getting all the practice
>
> on how to chat up.
>
> But now, guys aren't showing as much interest. And they're going to live really dangerously and
>
> stare back at you, and things are getting a bit saggy.
>
> And you know what makes this even worse? I read recently, as women get older, can I just pause for
>
> a second?
>
> I'm feeling very uncomfortable at the moment. I'm not going to say why, but if anyone wants to kill
>
> me after, you're welcome to do it.
>
> But what I read was that as women get older, their sex drive actually increases.
>
> So what we're saying is that all the women have zero gain. They don't know how to chat up men.
>
> They're super horny, and no one really wants to sleep with them.
>
> I know, it's terrible. It's terrible. I agree with that. And I thought, "I'm going to fix this. I
>
> need to find a way to fix this."
>
> I thought about it for a while, and I thought, "All we need is another group that has zero gain, is
>
> super horny, and no one really wants to fuck."
>
> Teenage boys. And luckily, I'm a bit of an entrepreneur. I'm developing an app. We're calling it "Teen-Da."
>
> That's where I'm going. The moral of the story is that you guys are very happy. Do not break up. It's
>
> brutal.
>
> Thanks a lot.
