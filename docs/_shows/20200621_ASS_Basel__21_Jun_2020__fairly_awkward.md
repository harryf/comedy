> Our first half. And this guy, he actually lives in Zurich with the rest of our
>
> crew.
>
> But he is originally British, and he's been living here in Switzerland for
>
> about 17 years.
>
> He's very funny. So ladies and gentlemen, our last comic of the first half.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fuchs, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> Thank you.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room of mostly English speakers like this, a lot of you think
>
> my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset when
>
> you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> I don't have to.
>
> I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them how-the and what-the.
>
> Just to give them a good start in life.
>
> But, no, one of the problems with a name like Harry Fuchs is I get a lot of
>
> stupid comments.
>
> Like recently this American tourist came up to me and he's like,
>
> Yo, Harry Fuchs. Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> And I was like, what?
>
> He's like, exactly, Harry Fuchs what, man?
>
> I'm like, alright, let me see if I can throw him off with some adverts.
>
> Um, Harry Fuchs hopefully, Harry Fuchs occasionally, Harry Fuchs enthusiastically,
>
> and he had no comeback to that, you know, Americans and all that, bro.
>
> Any Americans here?
>
> Yes?
>
> If we haven't offended Americans, yeah, oh my god, I hope not, I'm feeling,
>
> okay, okay, let's get back to the set quickly and move on fast.
>
> No, um, honestly, actually, though, the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs
>
> is, uh, there simply hasn't been enough fucking.
>
> In fact, recently, but most, because of lockdown and other things, uh, if I can
>
> share this with you, it's actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Ah, okay, I'm a little bit concerned that you guys haven't respected social
>
> distancing.
>
> I'm very impressed by this guy, he's just, this woman moved in, started smoking
>
> cigars, and he was like, fill up my flat with cigar smoke, I'm cool with that,
>
> very, but, okay, so I hadn't realized that I was coming to the Basel Nymphomaniacs
>
> Anonymous Meetup, um, so I guess I'm going to have to explain a little bit my
>
> condition, because when you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like
>
> you're hallucinating.
>
> Ha, ha, ha.
>
> Because you could be like.
>
> Walking down the street, and, uh, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's
>
> asses, and you look at them and think, uh, I wish that was me.
>
> Or, or you go into micro, you go into micro, you spot an axion on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two, bang, so if you're in a new
>
> dimension, it's just you and that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting
>
> steamy, you're oblivious to all the people walking down the street.
>
> And then you hear this, you're a man's shaman's decision, you look, and there's
>
> an old lady about to hit you with a handbag, and you think, um, she's nice.
>
> Yeah, so, that's how that's been going.
>
> And, you know, and during, so during lockdown, you know, I was very, like,
>
> locked down, very horny.
>
> My stupid brain gave me a stupid idea.
>
> It said, hey, why don't you give Tinder a try?
>
> Now, for you guys, maybe I expect, except for the front row here, for the, let's
>
> say the 20s and 30-year-olds in the audience, for you guys, Tinder is an
>
> amazing place.
>
> Because you get to swipe your way through hot, sexy bodies, and potential erotic
>
> encounters.
>
> And the dream that your prince, your perfect match might somehow be in this app.
>
> But for me, I have to deal with older Tinder.
>
> And older Tinder is a dud.
>
> It's a dark place.
>
> I have to swipe my way through broken marriages, drug and alcohol problems,
>
> faded tattoos saying, no regrets!
>
> It's brutal, you know.
>
> And the scariest thing, the scariest thing on older Tinder is the sight of a 50-year-old
>
> woman making a duck face.
>
> I mean, how?
>
> How the fuck do you get to be 50 and think that a duck face is okay?
>
> The only time a duck face is ever okay is when both your parents are ducks.
>
> And actually, ducks only live about 10 years.
>
> The universe has no place for a 50-year-old duck face.
>
> That shouldn't be happening.
>
> But maybe even worse than all the swiping is actually on that rare occasion you
>
> end up with a Tinder date.
>
> And all the Tinder dates.
>
> And, you know, and you go along and you're all kind of chirpy and happy and
>
> then you meet.
>
> And the conversation inevitably goes like, yeah, I fucked up the last 40 years
>
> of my life.
>
> But for some insane reason, I just think it's getting better from here.
>
> And then she's like, oh, I too fucked up my entire life.
>
> And you go, wow, we have something massively depressing in common.
>
> This is great.
>
> Hey, do you want to come back to my place?
>
> And then we can just kill ourselves.
>
> That would be the perfect end to this date.
>
> It's brutal.
>
> But, you know, and I just thought about this and I'm like, I hate this app.
>
> So I finally thought, that's it, I'm going to delete it.
>
> And just as I was going to delete the app, I got a message from this lady.
>
> It said, with those cute blue eyes, how is it you're still running around free?
>
> Now, aside from that being the worst pickup line ever.
>
> Can you imagine if I was to say that to any woman here?
>
> Like, you shouldn't be running around free.
>
> You should be tied up in my dungeon.
>
> That is fucking insane.
>
> That is an insane thing to say to anyone.
>
> And what it made me realize, it made me realize that actually maybe all the
>
> ladies have a bit of a problem.
>
> They don't really know how to chat up men.
>
> Because for all these years, like guys have been doing all the work.
>
> We've been getting all the practice.
>
> We've had a chat up.
>
> But now, guys aren't showing as much interest.
>
> And they're going to live really dangerously and stare back into it.
>
> And things are getting a bit saggy.
>
> And you know what makes this even worse?
>
> Is I read recently, is when they get older.
>
> Can I just pause for a second?
>
> I'm feeling very uncomfortable at the moment.
>
> I'm not going to say why.
>
> But anyone wants to kill me after, you're welcome to do it.
>
> No, what I read.
>
> Was that as women get older, their sex drive actually increases.
>
> So what we're saying is, is that all the women have zero game.
>
> They don't know how to chat up men.
>
> They're super horny.
>
> And no one really wants to sleep with them.
>
> I know it's terrible.
>
> It's terrible.
>
> I agree with that.
>
> And I thought, I'm going to fix this.
>
> I need to find a way to fix this.
>
> I thought about it for a while.
>
> I thought all we need is another group that has zero game.
>
> Is super horny.
>
> And that no one really wants to fuck.
>
> Teenage boys.
>
> And luckily I'm a bit of an entrepreneur.
>
> I'm developing an app.
>
> We're calling it Teen Dog.
>
> Alright, that's where I've gone.
>
> The moral of the story is, is that you guys are very happy.
>
> Do not break up.
>
> It's brutal.
>
> Okay, alright.
>
> Thanks a lot.
>
> Thank you.
>
> I was married to Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> He actually has a second job as a relationship partner.
