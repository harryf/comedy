> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs. It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S, I
>
> repeat F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room like this with English speakers a lot of you think my name is
>
> Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> In my family when we have a family get-together we get very upset when you call
>
> us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I call them Halver and Wopper.
>
> That way to give them a good start in life.
>
> Yeah, but honestly the problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is it sets a very
>
> high level of expectation.
>
> And honestly I've only done about this much fucking.
>
> But there has been a lot of dark and fucked up thoughts going on that I have to
>
> confess.
>
> And honestly I think it goes back to my childhood because I went to a Catholic
>
> school.
>
> But I got thrown out for molesting a priest.
>
> We're just warming you guys up for darker places.
>
> So, you know, do any of you guys know who Flat Earthers are? Have you heard of
>
> the Flat Earthers?
>
> Anyone? Okay, let me explain quickly.
>
> So Flat Earthers, they believe in this conspiracy that the earth is not round.
>
> They believe that is a lie told to us by the Illuminati, the lizard people.
>
> So that they can live in the good places and the rest of us live, I don't know,
>
> in Zurich.
>
> And, you know, it's kind of stupid but at the same point I kind of admire these
>
> guys.
>
> Because, you know, it's like they only believe what they experience with their
>
> own eyes.
>
> You know, they look around, it's all flat. Of course the world is flat.
>
> And I thought to myself, you know, like maybe there are other things.
>
> Maybe there are other things that we should be questioning, that we've been
>
> told about.
>
> But really that's not how it is, you know, like rape for example.
>
> I mean, you know, we've heard it's a really fucked up bad thing, you know.
>
> But maybe, maybe the Illuminati, the lizard people are just keeping it for
>
> themselves.
>
> I don't know, you know. I mean, and I think about this, I think, and sometimes
>
> I think,
>
> "Dude, this is fucked up. You shouldn't be thinking about this stuff."
>
> And I'm like, "Exactly, that's what the lizard people want. They don't want us
>
> thinking about this shit."
>
> So, you know, and I go, "So, Rafe, is it really that bad?"
>
> That was the thought. And I thought, you know, "Maybe I've just got to give it
>
> a try."
>
> And, you know, so I tried it and what I learned is getting raped is very fucked
>
> up.
>
> Fuck, man, that shit is horrible. It's horrible.
>
> You can't just like walk that shit off, you know, it's like this.
>
> And, you know, even lizard people don't like getting raped.
>
> So that's what I learned from that.
>
> The reason why I do that joke is actually because of the way I look.
>
> Because, you know, I'm in my middle age, bald head, beard,
>
> and you guys all kind of think, "Yeah, he looks a bit rapey."
>
> Because that's like the default. That's what everyone would think of a guy that
>
> looks like me.
>
> It's like you heard about me on the news. A man was seen running.
>
> And the police say he was mid-forties, white, bald head, and a beard.
>
> It's what everyone expects. It's so hard to be a white, middle-aged guy.
>
> And, you know, sometimes I go for a walk in the wood in the evening just to
>
> calm down after work.
>
> And I'm just never afraid. I'm never afraid.
>
> Because when I'm walking in the wood, I know if I meet anyone, they're going to
>
> be like, "Oh, fuck!"
>
> The only thing worse than meeting me would be meeting a group of clowns.
>
> That would be the only thing more fucked up.
>
> And I find that this kind of social stigma, I even do it myself.
>
> Because recently I was on a tram, and on the back of the tram there was a guy
>
> and his girlfriend, and they were kissing.
>
> And then I noticed that his girlfriend had Down syndrome.
>
> Down syndrome. And I thought, "That motherfucker."
>
> Because, like, if I had been a woman, if I had been a woman, I would have been
>
> like,
>
> "Wow, she's so loving, so caring, that she could take on the burden of a
>
> boyfriend with Down syndrome. What a wonderful person."
>
> But when I saw this guy, I was like, "Motherfucker."
>
> Because think about it. You think about what's going on in their relationship.
>
> Maybe I should explain a little bit, because I'm sensing a great deal of
>
> awkwardness about it.
>
> So, people with Down syndrome, they're very affectionate.
>
> And sometimes that kind of crosses into sexual feelings.
>
> And this guy, he's probably at home, and he's like, "Hey, honey. You want to
>
> play the lollipop game?"
>
> We've got a few laughs over here. I think the rest of you have checked out, so
>
> maybe I should just live swiftly on.
>
> But, you know, it's really a thing, because, I mean, the stigma to deal with it,
>
> it's made me realize that in society, it's kind of like a continuum.
>
> It's like a scale. It's kind of like, call it maybe the rapiness scale.
>
> Over here, over here, you've got the sick people, you've got the serial killers,
>
> you've got Bill Cosby, you've got Morris over here.
>
> And there's a scale that goes all the way over here.
>
> Except for my friend here.
>
> Over here, we have the friend zone.
>
> And when a guy meets a girl, he's like, there's this moment right at the
>
> beginning where he's like,
>
> "Where am I going to position myself on the rapiness scale?"
>
> If I'm like Chris, deep in the friend zone, I'm pushing this way. I need to be
>
> a bit more edgy, a bit more manly.
>
> But for me, it's really tough, because people are just like, "I'm just trying
>
> to be nice, go this way."
>
> That's a very nice shirt you have on there.
>
> That's totally creepy.
>
> One word of warning for Chris here. Do not stay in the friend zone too long,
>
> because there is a tunnel.
>
> It's like a black hole. It's called the incel tunnel.
>
> You stay there, you loop around here like that, and that's over, man. Don't do
>
> it.
>
> Okay. I think I'm done before I get arrested. Thank you, guys.
>
> Give it up for Harry Potts, everybody!
>
> - Wow.
