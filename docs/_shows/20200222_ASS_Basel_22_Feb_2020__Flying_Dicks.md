> I want to kill myself.
>
> That was some hard topics.
>
> I mean, that book is like, "Till the Grandma Dies" in British.
>
> Wow.
>
> Okay.
>
> So we've got one last comic left.
>
> It's Oscar.
>
> This guy, Oscar, you're going to love him, okay?
>
> He's British originally, but he's been living in Switzerland for about 18 years now.
>
> And yes, this is his real name. Give it up, everybody.
>
> It's Harry Fox. Give it up for Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fux.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halbert and Woffert
>
> just to give them a good starting line.
>
> I think you're laughing too much at my children, Halbert.
>
> But the real problem with a name like Harry Fux is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> Honestly, there's only been about this much.
>
> Honestly, it was that much. Probably that much.
>
> And in fact, if I can share this with you, it has actually been a long time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> You two guys?
>
> Wow, I hadn't realized I was coming to the Basel nymphomaniac society.
>
> Okay, well, let me then just explain to you my condition, how it is when you haven't had sex in a
>
> long time.
>
> Because it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be walking down the street.
>
> You see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> You look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, you spot an "Action on Watermelon."
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bang! It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> You and that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting steamy, you're oblivious to all the people
>
> watching you.
>
> And then you hear this, "Junger Mann, schämen Sie sich!"
>
> And there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, "She's nice."
>
> Yeah, so that's how that's working out for me.
>
> But I have lived in Switzerland a long time.
>
> And actually, right now, I'm in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> And when I get that passport, I'm going to be voting SVP.
>
> Because it's time to do something about all the immigrants.
>
> And specifically, I mean the English-speaking immigrants.
>
> You know, like Zach and Stephanie over there.
>
> Because let's look at these guys, you know.
>
> They voted for Brexit, they voted for Trump.
>
> And then they were like, "Oh my God, we fucked up our country!"
>
> "Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> But when they get here, you've got to ask, "What are they actually bringing to the party here?"
>
> Because, you know, like the Indians and the Vietnamese, when they came here, they brought great
>
> cuisine.
>
> Or the Brazilians and the Romanians, when they came here, they brought sexual relief.
>
> But these English speakers, I mean, they're just coming here and stealing our comedy jobs.
>
> It's just not acceptable.
>
> Yeah, but anyway.
>
> So how's your 2020 been going?
>
> You guys been having a fun 2020 so far?
>
> Wow, I'm in a room of depressed Nymphomaniacs.
>
> That is an interesting combination.
>
> I've also been having a shitty 2020 because, you know, I was also feeling kind of depressed.
>
> But for me, it's about the sex I'm not getting.
>
> And then I did what a real man does under these circumstances.
>
> I go on YouTube and watch animal videos.
>
> But then I found an animal that blew my mind.
>
> This animal is so incredible.
>
> I can hardly believe I got to this age and...
>
> Can you guess what animal I'm talking about?
>
> She, okay, she just plays eSports.
>
> She has no idea about animals and things.
>
> No, the animal I'm talking about, it's called the Argonaut Octopus.
>
> This thing is incredible.
>
> So I've got to explain this to you a bit first.
>
> So the female Argonaut Octopus is extremely aggressive.
>
> If the man gets anywhere near, she's going to eat it.
>
> The males are terrified of the females.
>
> And I spot a couple of guys who can relate to this, I think.
>
> But, you know, so the males have developed a unique solution.
>
> And for this, I've got to put on my David Attenborough voice, you know.
>
> When the male of the species spots a female, he detaches his penis.
>
> It swims through the water and homes in on her vagina.
>
> Okay, sorry, not your vagina.
>
> Sorry about that.
>
> But this is real, I kid you not.
>
> Let me put it in layman's terms.
>
> There's an octopus out there with a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> This thing is incredible.
>
> Google that shit.
>
> How are we not teaching kids in school about this stuff?
>
> But, you know, then I got thinking, like, you know, how would it be...
>
> How would it be if human beings had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be insane.
>
> That would, like, change everything.
>
> You know, like, imagine.
>
> It's just, like, it's Monday morning and Daphina there is, like, waiting at the tram stop,
>
> just thinking about all the IT guys she's going to intimidate with that deep voice of hers.
>
> And then suddenly, bam, this dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She's like, "Oh, fuck."
>
> She hides behind some old ladies to throw it off.
>
> She pulls out her dick shield like Captain America.
>
> Dicks are just flying everywhere.
>
> Dicks are hitting the shield.
>
> She jumps in the tram.
>
> She arrives at work.
>
> And luckily there's a sign saying, "Please keep your penis attached during office hours."
>
> Yeah, it's just, like, it's crazy.
>
> A world with detachable dicks.
>
> There is just so much to think about.
>
> We probably have, like, dick sports.
>
> Like, I don't know, dick racing.
>
> At the Olympics you got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike changes its logo to "Just Dick It."
>
> Okay, these guys are getting the jokes.
>
> The rest are just, like, in a state of shock about detachable dicks.
>
> But, you know, and the more I thought about it, it's just, like, endless questions.
>
> This is even more questions than what would happen if we had universal basic income.
>
> Because, like, can you imagine what would happen if you lost your dick?
>
> Wow, that would be terrifying.
>
> You just have to hope, like, pull out your phone.
>
> You got this app, "Find My Penis."
>
> Or, you know, could you borrow your friend's dick?
>
> That would be strange.
>
> It was like, "I wasn't cheating. It was his dick."
>
> It would be crazy.
>
> But then I thought more about this.
>
> And I thought, "But let's add some more variables."
>
> It's like, what if when you shoot your dick it's a one-time thing
>
> and then you have to wait three months for another dick to regrow?
>
> I sense this row of ladies is in a--
>
> Now, that is a very challenging--
>
> I don't think they really like this.
>
> Because, you know, it would mean, for example,
>
> that when they all go for brunch and talk about a guy that they met last night,
>
> they go, "Oh, last night was so romantic.
>
> He got down on one knee and gave me his dick."
>
> It would be beautiful.
>
> Or, you know, like when a son is talking to his dad,
>
> he's like, "Dad, do I really have to give my dick away?"
>
> And dad is like, "Son, when you meet the right woman--"
>
> Okay, I've got no reaction at all, but that's okay.
>
> We're going to push on.
>
> Because couples, for example, like Zach and Stephanie,
>
> you ask them how long they've been together.
>
> Instead of it being, like, 18 to 20 years,
>
> Zach would be like, "We've been together for about 72 dicks."
>
> And then Stephanie's like, "I think there were a few more than that."
>
> What? Where are all these missing dicks in this story?
>
> I don't know.
>
> Anyway, okay, that's my--
>
> I'm just going to leave you with just dicks floating in the room.
>
> Thank you.
>
> You guys have been a lot of fun.
>
> Have a great night.
>
> Let's give it up for Mr. Dick Hall.
