> How was the show called, ladies and gentlemen?
>
> It was some, uh...
>
> It was some hard topics.
>
> It was like, I mean, that's...
>
> It was like, it's like my grandma died in, uh,
>
> in the...
>
> Wow.
>
> Okay.
>
> We've got one last comic left.
>
> This guy,
>
> you're gonna love him, okay?
>
> He's British originally, but he's been living in
>
> Switzerland for about 18 years now.
>
> And yes, this is
>
> his real name. Give it up, everybody.
>
> It's Harry Fox. Give it up
>
> for Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
>
> So my name is actually
>
> Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-
>
> C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-
>
> C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers,
>
> there's a lot of you who think,
>
> my name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family,
>
> when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of
>
> fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them
>
> Halber and Woffer
>
> just to give them
>
> a good start in life.
>
> I think you're laughing too much
>
> at my children.
>
> But the real problem
>
> with a name like Harry Fox
>
> is it sets a very high level
>
> of expectation.
>
> Honestly, there's only been about this much.
>
> Honestly, it was that much.
>
> And, you know,
>
> in fact, if I can share this
>
> with you, it has actually been
>
> a long time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't
>
> had sex in a long time.
>
> You two guys.
>
> Wow.
>
> I hadn't realized I was coming to the
>
> Basel Nymphomania.
>
> Okay.
>
> Well, let me
>
> then just explain to you
>
> let me just explain to you my condition
>
> how it is when you haven't had sex
>
> in a long time because it's kind
>
> of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You know, you could be walking
>
> down the street. You see a couple of
>
> dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> You look at
>
> them and you think,
>
> I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into
>
> Migro. You go into Migro.
>
> You spot an axion on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand
>
> on that watermelon,
>
> maybe two.
>
> It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> You and that watermelon. It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy. You're oblivious
>
> to all the people watching you.
>
> And then you hear this
>
> and there's an old lady about to
>
> hit you with a handbag and you think,
>
> uh,
>
> she's nice.
>
> Yeah, so that's how that's working
>
> out for me. But I have lived
>
> in Switzerland a long time and
>
> actually right now I'm in the process
>
> of applying for my Swiss passport.
>
> And when I get that passport
>
> I'm going to be voting
>
> espalpé
>
> because it's time to do something about
>
> all the immigrants.
>
> And specifically, I mean
>
> the English-speaking immigrants.
>
> You know, like Zach and Stephanie over there.
>
> Because let's look at these guys, you know.
>
> They voted for Brexit.
>
> They voted for Trump.
>
> And then they were like,
>
> "Oh my God, we fucked up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> But when they get here, you've got to ask,
>
> "What are they actually bringing to the party here?"
>
> Because, you know, like the Indians and the Vietnamese,
>
> when they came here, they brought great cuisine.
>
> Or the Brazilians and the Romanians,
>
> when they came here, they brought sexual relief.
>
> But these English speakers, I mean,
>
> they're just coming here and stealing our comedy jobs.
>
> It's just not acceptable.
>
> Yeah, but anyway.
>
> So how's your 2020 been going?
>
> You guys been having a fun 2020 so far?
>
> Wow, I'm in a room of depressed nymphomanians.
>
> That is an interesting combination.
>
> I've also been having a shitty 2020 because, you know,
>
> I was also feeling kind of depressed.
>
> But for me, it's about the sex I'm not getting.
>
> And, you know, and then I did what a real man does
>
> under these circumstances.
>
> I go on YouTube and watch animal videos.
>
> But then I found an animal that blew my mind.
>
> This animal is so incredible.
>
> I can hardly believe I got to this age and not...
>
> Can you guess what animal I'm talking about?
>
> She, okay, she just plays esports.
>
> She has no idea about animals and things like that.
>
> No, the animal I'm talking about,
>
> it's called the Argonaut octopus.
>
> This thing is incredible.
>
> So I've got to explain this to you a bit first.
>
> So the female Argonaut octopus is extremely aggressive.
>
> If the man gets anywhere near, she's going to eat it.
>
> So the males are terrified of the females.
>
> And I spot a couple of guys who can relate to this,
>
> I think.
>
> Yeah.
>
> But, you know, so the males have developed a unique solution.
>
> And for this, I got to put on my David Attenborough voice.
>
> When the male of the species spots a female,
>
> he detaches his penis.
>
> It swims through the water and homes in on her vagina.
>
> Okay, sorry, not your vagina, sorry about that.
>
> But this is real.
>
> I kid you not, let me put it in layman's terms.
>
> There's an octopus out there with a detachable penis.
>
> It's a detachable, heat-seeking dick.
>
> This thing is incredible, Google that shit.
>
> How are we not teaching kids in school about this stuff?
>
> But, you know, then I got thinking, like, you know,
>
> how would it be, how would it be if human beings
>
> had detachable dicks?
>
> That would be insane.
>
> That would, like, change everything.
>
> You know, like, imagine, it's just like,
>
> it's Monday morning and Daphina there is, like,
>
> waiting at the tram stop, just thinking about all the things.
>
> You know, like, imagine, it's just like, it's Monday morning and Daphina there
>
> is, like, waiting at the tram stop just thinking about all the things.
>
> You know, like, imagine, it's just like, it's Monday morning and Daphina there
>
> is, like, waiting at the tram stop just thinking about all the things.
>
> thinking about all the IT guys she's gonna intimidate with that deep voice of
>
> hers.
>
> And then suddenly, BAM! This dick just slaps her in the face.
>
> She's like, "Oh, fuck!" She hides behind some old ladies to throw it off.
>
> She pulls out her dick shield like Captain America.
>
> Dicks are just flying everywhere. Dicks are hitting the shield.
>
> She jumps in the tram. She arrives at work.
>
> And luckily there's a sign saying,
>
> "Please keep your penis attached during office hours."
>
> Yeah, it's just like, it's crazy.
>
> The world, a world with detachable dicks.
>
> There is just so much to think about.
>
> We probably have, like, dick sports.
>
> Like, I don't know, dick racing.
>
> At the Olympics, you got the dickathlon.
>
> Nike changes its logo to "Just Dick It."
>
> Okay, these guys are getting the jokes arrested, just like,
>
> in a state of shock about detachable dicks.
>
> But, you know, and the more I thought about it, the, it's just like, it's crazy.
>
> But, you know, and the more I thought about it, the, it's just like, it's crazy.
>
> But, you know, and the more I thought about it, the, it's just like, it's crazy.
>
> But, you know, and the more I thought about it, the, it's just like, it's crazy.
>
> But, you know, and the more I thought about it, the, it's just like, endless
>
> questions.
>
> It's just even more questions than what would happen if we had universal basic
>
> income.
>
> Because, like, can you imagine what would happen if you lost your dick?
>
> Wow, that would be terrifying.
>
> You just have to hope, like, pull out your phone, you got this app, Find My Penis.
>
> Or, you know, could you borrow your friend's dick?
>
> That would be strange.
>
> It was like, I wasn't cheating, it was his dick.
>
> It would be crazy.
>
> But then, then I thought more about this, and I thought, but let's add some
>
> more variables.
>
> So, it's like, what if when you shoot your dick, it's a one-time thing, and
>
> then you
>
> have to wait three months for another dick to regrow?
>
> I think, I, I sense this row of ladies is in a, now that is a very challenging,
>
> I don't
>
> think they really like this.
>
> Because, you know, it would mean, for example, that when, when they all go for
>
> brunch and
>
> talk about a guy that they met.
>
> Yeah.
>
> Last night, they go, oh, last night was so romantic.
>
> He got down on one knee and gave me his dick.
>
> Be beautiful.
>
> Or, you know, like when a son is talking to his dad, he's like, dad, do I
>
> really have
>
> to give my dick away?
>
> And dad is like, son, when you meet the right woman.
>
> Okay, I got no reaction at all, but that's okay, we're going to push on.
>
> Because couples, for example, like Zach and Stephanie, you know, you ask them
>
> how long
>
> they've been together.
>
> It would be like 18 to 20 years.
>
> Zach would be like, we've been together for about 72 dicks.
>
> And then Stephanie's like, I think there were a few more than that.
>
> What, where are all these missing dicks in this story?
>
> I don't know.
>
> Anyway, okay, that's my, I'm just going to leave you with just dicks floating
>
> in the
>
> room.
>
> Thank you.
>
> You guys have been a lot of fun.
>
> Have a great night.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Give it up for.
>
> Mr. Dixieland.
