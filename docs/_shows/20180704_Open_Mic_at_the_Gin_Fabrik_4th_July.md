> I am so excited for this guy. He's going to be great. So let's give a big round
>
> of applause. Here he is, everybody. Harry Fuchs, everybody.
>
> So actually, my name is Harry Fuchs. That's a German name. Unfortunately, a lot
>
> of English speakers seem to think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs. If my name was Harry Fuchs, I would have come on
>
> stage and said,
>
> Yo, what's up? Harry Fuchs in the house. But that's not really me.
>
> And, you know, honestly, there's just been way too little sex for me to qualify
>
> as Harry Fuchs.
>
> In fact, recently I was dumped by my first Swiss girlfriend after four and a
>
> half years.
>
> And that, of course, means that I'm not qualified as an expert on all Swiss
>
> women. Indeed.
>
> One of the things that's hard about having a Swiss girlfriend is they don't
>
> communicate very well.
>
> They don't express themselves very well, especially towards men.
>
> And the surprising reason for this is actually that Switzerland has a very poor
>
> track record on women's rights.
>
> It was actually only until 1991 that the last canton,
>
> of Appenzell-Inneboden, finally agreed to give women the right to have orgasms.
>
> So, compared to their German or British or American sisters, Swiss women are
>
> still catching up.
>
> They're still learning the fine arts of nagging and making their men feel
>
> miserable.
>
> But for any of you that end up in a similar position to what I was in,
>
> here are a few key phrases that may help you understand.
>
> So, for example, if she says to you,
>
> This is a good thing.
>
> This means that later on there is a high probability of receiving sexual favors.
>
> But if she says,
>
> Then probably you should spend the night on the sofa.
>
> Or if she says to you,
>
> This is a good thing.
>
> That means she's as horny as a horse.
>
> That means she's as horny as a horse.
>
> That means she's as horny as a horse.
>
> But if she says,
>
> Lick me doch am Arsch!
>
> Lick me doch am Arsch!
>
> Under no circumstances should you lick her asshole.
>
> Lick me doch am Arsch!
>
> Unless she follows it with,
>
> Das ist ein Schießdreck!
>
> Which means that you could think about it,
>
> but you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> But you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> But you might be in for a nasty surprise.
>
> Yeah, so international relations are hard.
>
> I understand this. I've been living in Switzerland for a long time.

> I came originally from the UK.

> Actually right now I'm in the process of applying for my Swiss passport.
>

>
> Thank you.
>
> It's great to get the support from the two Swiss people here.
>
> It's great to get the support from the two Swiss people here.

>
> Because actually what I'm going to do when I get that passport,

>
> is I'm going to be voting SVP.
>
> And the reason for that is,
>
> it's time we do something about the immigrants.
>
> it's time we do something about the immigrants.
>
> All the goddamn English-speaking immigrants.
>
> All the goddamn English-speaking immigrants.

> We've got to deal with them.
>
> Because take a look at it.
>
> What have they been doing?
>
> They voted for Brexit.
>
> They voted for Trump.
>
> And then they went, "Oh my God, we've fucked up our country.
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland."
>
> Let's just sneak over to Switzerland.

> But if you look at what are they actually bringing

>
> The Italians or the Vietnamese,
>
> they came here, they brought fantastic cuisine.
>
> Or the Romanians or the Brazilians,
>
> they came here and brought sexual relief.
>

>
> But, you know,
>
> these goddamn English speakers,
>
> they're not even trying to learn the language.
>
> They're going out in the evening
>
> and listening to English stand-up comedy.
>
> So, you know,
>
> I'm going to stop this country getting stolen.
>
> And, you know, this is because
>
> this actually goes back to my childhood
>
> because when I was just seven years old
>
> something was taken from me.
>
> That's right, I was circumcised.
>
> I see that not everyone understands
>
> what the word "circumcised" means.
>
> Come and talk to me afterwards.
>
> Now, I wasn't
>
> circumcised for religious reasons.
>
> Actually, it was a medical emergency
>
> and the only way they could save my life
>
> was by cutting off my foreskin.
>
> But what began as
>
> a very traumatic childhood experience
>
> in later life actually turned into
>
> a real advantage because what I found is
>
> that on those rare occasions
>
> where a woman would come into close proximity
>
> with the tip of my penis,
>
> she would sigh
>
> like this, like
>
> and I would go,
>
> "Hey, why are you sighing on my penis?"
>
> And she'd say,
>
> "You have no idea what a reliever it is.
>
> There are so many dirty dicks out there."
>
> And so what I learned is
>
> that actually, this was news to me,
>
> that amongst my uncut brethren,
>
> that a lot of you guys are not putting
>
> enough attention in this area.
>
> So I thought I'd wrap up with a few tips
>
> to help you guys make your woman's
>
> life more pleasant.
>
> So the first thing you can do is air freshener.
>
> You know like that thing you have
>
> in your car on the rear view mirror
>
> hanging from your penis?
>
> That will immediately
>
> make her life more pleasant because
>
> women are very sensitive to smell.
>
> Women are also very visual.
>
> So another thing you could do is
>
> right above your penis, right here,
>
> tattoo a pleasant scene
>
> like a field of grass
>
> with some flowers growing
>
> or maybe a tree with
>
> a few birds cheeping in it.
>
> Something to take her mind off
>
> the disgusting act she has to perform.
>
> Because
>
> the simplest and most effective
>
> thing you can do is bring a box of crackers
>
> so that when she's there,
>
> you can just kind of feed her the crackers.
>
> Because
>
> cheese goes really well with crackers.
>
> Alright, that's it. Thank you.
>
> Keep it clean.
>
> Especially useful ones.
>
> Have a good night.
