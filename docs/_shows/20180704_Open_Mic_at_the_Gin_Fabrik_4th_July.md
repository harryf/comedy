>
> round of applause
>

>
> unfortunately a lot of english speakers seem to think my name is harry fux
>
> my name is not harry fux my name was harry fux i would have come on stage and
>
> said
>
> yo what's up harry fux in the house but that's that's not really me and uh you
>
> know honestly
>
> there's just been way too little sex for me to qualify as harry fux
>
> in fact uh recently i was dumped by my first swiss girlfriend after four and a
>
> half years
>
> and that of course means that i'm not qualified as an expert on all swiss women
>
> indeed one of the things that's hard about having a swiss girlfriend is they
>
> don't communicate very
>
> well they don't express themselves very well especially towards men and the
>
> surprising
>
> reason for this is actually that switzerland has a very poor track record on
>
> women's rights
>
> it was actually only until 1991 that the last canton
>
> of appenzell innervalle finally agreed to give women the right to have orgasms
>
> so compared to their german or british or american sisters swiss women are
>
> still catching up they're
>
> still learning the fine arts of nagging and making their men feel miserable but
>
> if uh for any of you
>
> that end up in a similar position to what i what i was in here are a few key
>
> phrases that may help
>
> you understand her better so for example if she says to you "oh schätzli" this
>
> is a good thing
>
> this means that later on there is a high probability of receiving sexual favors
>
> but if she says "schatz"
>
> then probably you should spend the night on the sofa
>
> or if she says to you
>
> this is a good thing that means she's as horny as a whore
>
> but if she says "leck mich doch am Arsch"
>
> under no circumstances should you lick her asshole
>
> unless she follows it with "das ist ein schiestreck"
>
> which means that you could think about it but you might be in for a nasty
>
> surprise
>
> yeah so international relations are hard you know i understand this i've been
>
> living in switzerland
>
> now for 17 years i came originally from the uk and actually right now i'm in
>
> the process of
>
> applying for my swiss passport thank you all right it's great to get the
>
> support from the two swiss
>
> people here um because actually what i'm going to do when i get that passport
>
> is i'm going to be
>
> voting svp and the reason for that is it's time we do something about the
>
> immigrants
>
> all the goddamn english-speaking immigrants i mean the brits
>
> the yanks the canadians the kiwis the aussies we got to deal with them because
>
> take a look at it
>
> what have they been doing they voted for brexit they voted for trump
>
> and then they went oh my god we fucked up our country let's just sneak over to
>
> switzerland
>
> but if you look at what are they actually bringing to this party here in switzerland
>
> i mean
>
> like the indians or the vietnamese they came here they brought fantastic
>
> cuisine
>
> or the romanians or the brazilians they came here and brought sexual relief
>
> but you know these these goddamn english speakers they're not even trying to
>
> learn
>
> the language they're going out in the evening and listening to english stand-up
>
> comedy
>
> so uh you know i'm going to stop this country getting stolen and you know this
>
> is because
>
> this actually goes back to my childhood because uh when i was just seven years
>
> old
>
> something was taken from me that's right i was circumcised i see that not
>
> everyone understands
>
> what the word circumcised means come and talk to me afterwards now i wasn't
>
> circumcised for
>
> religious reasons actually it was a medical emergency and the only way they
>
> could save
>
> my life was by cutting off my foreskin but what began as a very traumatic
>
> childhood experience
>
> in later life actually turned into a real advantage because what i found is
>
> that on
>
> those rare occasions where a woman would come into close proximity with the tip
>
> of my penis
>
> she would sigh like this like and i would go hey why are you sighing on my
>
> penis and she said you
>
> have no idea what a relief it is there are so many dirty dicks out there
>
> and so what i learned is that actually this was news to me that amongst my uncut
>
> brethren
>
> that a lot of you guys are not putting enough attention in this area
>
> so i thought i'd wrap up with a few tips to help you guys make your woman's
>
> life more pleasant
>
> so the first thing you can do is air freshener you know like that thing you
>
> have
>
> in your car on the rear camera hanging from your penis
>
> that will immediately make her life more pleasant because women are very
>
> sensitive to smell
>
> women are also very visual so another thing you could do is right above your
>
> penis about here
>
> tattoo a pleasant scene like like a field of grass with some flowers growing
>
> or maybe or maybe a tree with a few birds cheating in it
>
> something to take her mind off the disgusting act she has to look like
>
> because the simplest and most effective thing you can do is bring a box of
>
> crackers
>
> so that when she's down there you can just kind of feed her the crackers
>
> because cheese goes really well with crackers
>
> All right, that's it. Thank you. Keep it clean. I appreciate you for having me.
