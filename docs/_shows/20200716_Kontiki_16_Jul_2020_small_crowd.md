> First comedian of the second half. He is a British man, but he's been living
>
> here in Switzerland for the past 17 years.
>
> And yes, this is his real name. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Harry Fox,
>
> ladies and gentlemen!
>
> Wow. What a cute crowd, you know. It's a nice bunch of people. It's kind of an
>
> intimate atmosphere. Kind of sexy.
>
> Well, at least for me. For you guys, you've got to look at a bald, creepy dude
>
> on stage for the next five minutes.
>
> Now, my name is actually Harry Fox. It's a German name. Spelled F-U-C-K-S. I
>
> repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my
>
> name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox. And in my family...
>
> When we have a family get-together, we get very upset when you call us a group
>
> of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them how-the and what-the.
>
> Just to give them a good start on life.
>
> So that's one of the things I'm dealing with. Another thing I'm dealing with is
>
> clearly I'm old.
>
> Michelle, can you guess how old I am?
>
> No.
>
> I don't like that the answer begins with laughter.
>
> Oh, your age is... Oh, my God.
>
> No, I'm still laughing for the food and the...
>
> Oh, you're catching up.
>
> Let's move. Is it Sidonia? What's your name?
>
> Sidonia.
>
> Sidonia. Okay, Sidonia. Are you caught up? Are you all with me right now?
>
> I'm with you.
>
> Okay, great.
>
> So, how old are you?
>
> How old do you think I am, Sidonia?
>
> 40.
>
> 40? Okay, that's kind of in the right ballpark. It's a little bit out of 46.
>
> How old are you, Sidonia?
>
> 26.
>
> 26? Jesus Christ. I mean, I could literally be your father.
>
> How old's your mom?
>
> 49?
>
> 59.
>
> 59. Okay, okay. So, if she'd slept with me and produced you, that would make
>
> your mom a pedophile.
>
> No, it's just the facts. It's just the facts. But, you know, let's keep going
>
> with this.
>
> Lisa, can I just ask one more question, Sidonia? Is she hot?
>
> I mean, I'm good at this stuff.
>
> Oh, yeah, obviously, you know, it's the whole genes that you've been spreading
>
> in this group here.
>
> I sure feel like this...
>
> This is like some kind of victim support group, like this ex-boyfriend.
>
> It's like they meet up to talk shit about the guy.
>
> Anyway, I am an old guy. I have... I'm a single dad. I have two teenage kids.
>
> And, actually, they live with me.
>
> And living with teenage kids is like living in a baby, like in a flat shed.
>
> Because it's always a fucking mess. There's never any milk.
>
> And I get to pay for everything. It's the shittest flat.
>
> It's the shittest flat shed ever.
>
> But, and also, I have to deal with teenage issues.
>
> Like, recently, I caught my teenage son looking at porn.
>
> Luckily, I could point him at all the best categories. I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> And also, he plays GTA a lot. You guys know GTA: Grand Theft Auto?
>
> And a lot of people say, like, "Why do you let your son play this? That's not a
>
> good thing for kids."
>
> But, actually, I think GTA is teaching him some important life skills.
>
> Like, he's learned to sit still in a chair for eight hours without moving,
>
> eating, or going to the toilet.
>
> Which is, obviously, great preparation for future office life.
>
> And his English has improved a lot. I've heard him saying some key English
>
> phrases like, "Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
>
> "And I will piss on you like Donald Trump."
>
> You know, you've got to be a responsible parent.
>
> But I also have a teenage daughter. Now, that, wow, that is hard to deal with.
>
> Because, recently, I came back from work. I went into the bathroom and, oh my
>
> god, it looked like a crime scene in there.
>
> Wow, there was, like, a bloody handprint on the mirror, drops of blood in the
>
> sink, more blood on the floor, and the toilet looked like something from a
>
> horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming. And I looked around. And I realized the screaming
>
> was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter showed up and said, "Hey, Dad, I got my period!"
>
> And I'm like, "Wow, okay." So after cleaning up her menstrual blood... I mean,
>
> you don't think I'm going to let her do that. She's just going to smear it
>
> around and shit. That's her parental stuff.
>
> After cleaning that up, I said, "Hey, Dad, I got my period." And she said, "Hey,
>
> Dad, I got my period." And I'm like, "Wow, okay." So after cleaning up her
>
> menstrual blood... I mean, you don't think I'm going to let her do that. She's
>
> just going to smear it around and shit. That's her parental stuff.
>
> After cleaning that up, I said, "Hey, Daughter, can I get you something?" And
>
> she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, as obviously as a man, I'm completely unqualified for this, but I thought,
>
> "It can't be that hard."
>
> So I went over to Migo. I took a look around. And what I discovered is that
>
> tampon product names are exactly no use whatsoever when I'm constituting a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like OB Pro.
>
> What is that? For professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> I don't think I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> What are we talking here?
>
> Like glow-in-the-dark tampons so when you've got to get it in with the lights
>
> off?
>
> I don't know.
>
> There's more.
>
> And the one I like the most...
>
> I think I'm going to just play to this corner of the room.
>
> The one I like the most is called Always Infinity.
>
> Wow.
>
> That is for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> It's amazing.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always.
>
> It's called Always Home By 11.
>
> Wow.
>
> Wow.
>
> Because around about 10 o'clock it starts to leak and she is always home by 11.
>
> And this whole experience for me was a very proud one as a father.
>
> Because...
>
> It's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her
>
> vagina.
>
> It's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her
>
> vagina.
>
> It's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her
>
> vagina.
>
> It's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her
>
> vagina.
>
> Thank you.
>
> Thank you. Thank you.
>
> That's ruined this crowd.
>
> Thanks a lot guys.

> - Harry Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
