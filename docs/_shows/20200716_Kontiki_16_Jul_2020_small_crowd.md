> First comedian of the second half, he is a British man, but he's been living here in Switzerland
>
> for the past 17 years.
>
> And yes, this is his real name. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Harry Fox, ladies and
>
> gentlemen!
>
> Wow. What a cute crowd, you know. It's a nice bunch of people, it's kind of an intimate atmosphere,
>
> kind of sexy.
>
> Well, at least for me. For you guys, you've got to look at a bald, creepy dude on stage for the
>
> next five minutes.
>
> Now, my name is actually Harry Fux. It's a German name, spelled F-U-C-K-S. I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But when I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux. And in my family, when we have a family get-together, we get very upset
>
> when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them "how the" and "what the" just to give them a good starting
>
> line.
>
> So that's one of the things I'm dealing with. Another thing I'm dealing with is, clearly, I'm old.
>
> Michelle, can you guess how old I am? I don't like that the answer begins with "laughter."
>
> "How old are you?" "Oh, my God!"
>
> I'm still laughing for the "what the" and the...
>
> Oh, you're catching up.
>
> Next, let's move. Is it Sidonia? What's your name?
>
> Sidonia. Okay, Sidonia. Are you caught up? Are you all with me right there?
>
> Okay, great. So, how old do you think I am, Sidonia?
>
> 40? Okay, that's kind of in the right ballpark. It's a little bit up. 46. How old are you, Sidonia?
>
> 26. Jesus Christ. I mean, I could literally be your father.
>
> How old's your mom? 49? 59? Okay, okay.
>
> So, if she'd slept with me and you produced, that wouldn't make your mom a paedophile.
>
> It's just the facts. But, you know, let's keep going with this.
>
> Lisa, can I just ask one more question, Sidonia? Is she hot?
>
> I mean, I'm good at this stuff. Yeah, obviously, you know, it's the whole genes that you've been
>
> spreading in this group here.
>
> I should feel like this is, like, some kind of victim support group, like this ex-boyfriend.
>
> It's like they meet up to talk shit about the guy.
>
> Anyway, I am an old guy. I'm a single dad. I have two teenage kids, and actually, they live with me.
>
> And living with teenage kids is like living in a baby, like in a flat share, because it's always a
>
> fucking mess.
>
> There's never any milk, and I get to pay for everything. It is the shittest flat share ever.
>
> And also, I have to deal with teenage issues. Like, recently, I caught my teenage son looking at
>
> porn.
>
> Luckily, I could point him at all the best categories. I'm a bit of an expert.
>
> And also, he plays GTA a lot. You guys know GTA, Grand Theft Auto?
>
> And a lot of people say, like, why do you let your son play this? That's not a good thing for kids.
>
> But, actually, I think GTA is teaching him some important life skills.
>
> Like, he's learned to sit still in a chair for eight hours without moving, eating, or going to the
>
> toilet,
>
> which is obviously great preparation for future office life.
>
> And his English has improved a lot. I've heard him saying some key English phrases like,
>
> "Bitch, I will fuck you up! And I will piss on you like Donald Trump!"
>
> You know, you've got to be a responsible parent.
>
> But I also have a teenage daughter. Now that, wow, that is hard to deal with.
>
> Because, recently, I came back from work. I went into the bathroom, and oh my god, it looked like a
>
> crime scene in there.
>
> Wow, there was, like, a bloody handprint on the mirror, drops of blood in the sink, more blood on
>
> the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around, and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter showed up and said, "Hey, Dad! I got my period!"
>
> And I'm like, "Wow, okay." So after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> I mean, I don't think I'm going to let her do that. She's just going to smear it around and shit.
>
> That's her parental stuff. After cleaning that up, I said, "Hey, daughter, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now, obviously, as a man, I'm completely unqualified for this, but it can't be that hard.
>
> I went over to MeGo, I took a look around, and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like "OB Pro."
>
> What is that, like, for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> I don't think I want that for my daughter. Or "Tampax Radiance."
>
> What are we talking here, like, glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> So when you got to get it in with the lights off? I don't know.
>
> There's more. And the one I like the most, I think I'm going to just play to this corner of the
>
> room.
>
> The one I like the most is called "Always Infinity." Wow.
>
> That is for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole. It's amazing.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always, it's called "Always Home by Eleven." Wow.
>
> Wow, because right about ten o'clock it starts to leak, and she is always home by eleven.
>
> And this whole experience for me was a very proud one as a father,
>
> because it's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Let's ruin this crowd.
>
> Hey, thanks a lot, guys.
