>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U.
>
> C-K-S-R-E-P-E-F-U.
>
> C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fux.
>
> My name is not Harry Fux.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get really upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halber and Watber.
>
> Just to give them a good starting line.
>
> Yeah, but, you know, anyway, it's seasonal time.
>
> Did you guys feel it last weekend?
>
> Did you feel it? That first chill of autumn?
>
> You know, the leaves are turning, the days are getting shorter,
>
> the ladies are out hunting their winter boyfriends.
>
> I sense a lot of that might be happening back here.
>
> Yeah, because I'm 47.
>
> I've been on this planet studying the human race for a long time.
>
> And this is the stuff that you learn is that is that ladies,
>
> the female of the species, has seasonal dating habits.
>
> This is true.
>
> In springtime, in springtime, they seek out a nice muscly man,
>
> a man with a six pack that you can take to the pool to show to your friends.
>
> Like Cruz over there, you know, he has a name like Cruz.
>
> But round about August, you dump him because his face, he's a fucking idiot.
>
> And then you move on to someone like Saeed.
>
> Does he have a cute smile?
>
> Like, you know, he's a nice guy.
>
> You could just snuggle up with him all winter.
>
> Isn't that great?
>
> Saeed, I hope you don't play any online games.
>
> It's not happening for you this winter.
>
> You're going to be snuggled. What games do you play, Saeed?
>
> -No. -You don't play?
>
> -No. -This is perfect winter boyfriend material.
>
> Don't let him leave that door, ladies.
>
> But I do have a lot of sympathy for women,
>
> especially I read something recently that blew my mind.
>
> So scientists have figured out
>
> that men only reach mental and emotional maturity at the age of 43.
>
> That is insane, isn't it?
>
> I haven't matured for only four years.
>
> That's fucking crazy.
>
> For women, it happens at 32.
>
> Women are 11 years ahead of us.
>
> That is insane.
>
> And it's like, I really feel for you, ladies,
>
> that you have to deal with this stupid shit for so long.
>
> But then I see a couple like these two back here.
>
> They're both about 25 from the looks of it.
>
> Is that about right, 25?
>
> 25, yeah.
>
> And what that actually is with this 11-year gap
>
> is a 13-year-old...
>
> with someone that has a strange love of young men.
>
> I feel very uncomfortable.
>
> So if you need rescuing from this situation, I'm there for you.
>
> And I don't want to imply that women are a bit child-blessed.
>
> But it does explain a lot of things.
>
> Like at the wedding, it's always puzzled me.
>
> You know, you have the bride and the bridegroom.
>
> Like, why is he called the bridegroom?
>
> Is it 'cause she spent five years grooming him for this moment?
>
> OK, too much truth there. I'm sorry.
>
> We'll move swiftly on.
>
> So for me, all of this stuff, I'm out of this thing.
>
> I'm old. I'm a dad. I'm a single dad.
>
> But I have kids that live with me.
>
> So I don't have time for all this dating thing.
>
> And if I can share something with you...
>
> It has actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> OK. OK, I hadn't realised that I was coming to the Zurich Nymphomaniacs meet-up.
>
> All right. OK, well, then maybe if I can explain my condition to you,
>
> how it is when you haven't had sex in a long time,
>
> it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Cos you could be walking down the street,
>
> you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses,
>
> and you look at them and think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, you go into Migros,
>
> you spot an action on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bam! It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting steamy,
>
> you're oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear, "There's a young man shaving his neck," and you look,
>
> and there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag,
>
> and you think, "She's nice."
>
> All right, that's all I've got to you.
>
> You go there and we'll take care of it.
>
> Don't you ever try and get out of here alone.
>
> Yes, that was hairy, ladies and gentlemen.
