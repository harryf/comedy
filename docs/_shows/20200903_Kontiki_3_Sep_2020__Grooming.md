> A British man who's been living here in Switzerland for the past 17 years
>
> and yes, this is his real name.
>
> Give it up for Harry Fuchs, everybody!
>
> Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U.
>
> C-K-S-R-O-P-F-U.
>
> C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get really upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halbert and Wilbur.
>
> What the?
>
> Just to give them a good start.
>
> Yeah, but anyway, it's seasonal time.
>
> Did you guys feel it last weekend?
>
> Did you feel it, that first chill of autumn?
>
> You know, the leaves are turning, the days are getting shorter,
>
> the ladies are out hunting their winter boyfriends.
>
> I sense a lot of that might be happening back here.
>
> Yeah.
>
> Now, because I'm 47, I've been on this planet
>
> studying the human race for a long time.
>
> And this is the stuff that you learn,
>
> is that ladies, the female of the species,
>
> has seasonal dating habits.
>
> This is true.
>
> In springtime, in springtime,
>
> they seek out a nice muscly man,
>
> a man with a six-pack that you can take to the pool
>
> to show to your friends, like,
>
> cruise over there, you know?
>
> He has a name like Cruise.
>
> But right about August, you dump him,
>
> because let's face it, he's a fucking idiot.
>
> And then you move on to someone like Saeed.
>
> Doesn't he have a cute smile?
>
> Like, you know, he's a nice guy.
>
> You could just snuggle up with him all winter.
>
> Isn't that great?
>
> Saeed, I hope you don't play any online games.
>
> It's not happening for you this winter.
>
> You're going to be snuggled.
>
> What games do you play, Saeed?
>
> No.
>
> You don't play?
>
> No.
>
> This is perfect winter boyfriend.
>
> Don't let him leave that door, ladies.
>
> But I do have a lot of sympathy for women,
>
> especially, I read something recently that blew my mind.
>
> So, scientists have figured out
>
> that men only reach mental and emotional maturity
>
> at the age of 43.
>
> That is insane, isn't it?
>
> I'm mature for only four years.
>
> That's fucking crazy.
>
> For women, it happens at 34.
>
> Women are 11 years ahead of us.
>
> That is insane.
>
> And it's like, I really feel for you ladies
>
> that you have to deal with this stupid shit for so long.
>
> But then I see a couple like these two back here.
>
> They're both about 25 from the looks of it.
>
> Are they about right?
>
> 25?
>
> 25, yeah.
>
> And what that actually is with this 11-year gap
>
> is a 13-year-old.
>
> With someone that has a strange love of you.
>
> Young men.
>
> I feel very uncomfortable.
>
> So, if you need rescuing from this situation,
>
> I'm there for you.
>
> I don't want to imply that, you know,
>
> that women are a bit child-honest-y.
>
> But it does explain a lot of things.
>
> Like, at the wedding, it's always puzzled me.
>
> You know, you have the bride and the bridegroom.
>
> Like, why is he called the bridegroom?
>
> Is it because she spent five years grooming him for this moment?
>
> Okay, too much truth there.
>
> I'm sorry.
>
> We'll move swiftly on.
>
> So, for me, all of this stuff, I'm out of this thing.
>
> I'm old, I'm a dad, I'm a single dad.
>
> But I have kids that live with me.
>
> So, I don't have time for all this dating thing.
>
> And if I can share something with you,
>
> it has actually been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Okay, okay.
>
> I hadn't realized that I was coming to the Zurich Nymphomaniacs meetup.
>
> All right.
>
> Okay, well, then maybe if I can explain my condition to you,
>
> how it is when you haven't had sex in a long time,
>
> it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because you could be walking down the street,
>
> you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses,
>
> and you look at them and think,
>
> I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into Migo, you go into Migo,
>
> you spot,
>
> and that's your own on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bam, it's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot, it's getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> "You're my man's shaman, Zizek, can you look?"
>
> And there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag.
>
> And you think, "She's nice."
>
> All right, that's all I've got to you.
>
> You go there and we'll check out.
>
> Don't yet.
>
> We'll check out if you're alive.
>
> Yes, that was hairy, ladies and gentlemen.
