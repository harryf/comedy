<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> We've almost made it to the end of tonight, okay. We have one last comedian left in tonight's show.
>
> Now before that, I want to tell you guys a couple of things.
>
> First of all, folks, this is a donation-based mic, okay.
>
> This open mic gets promoted through your donations.
>
> So right there at the door, you see Vanessa is holding our little donation box there.
>
> So please throw in some money so we can continue doing this stuff.
>
> Whatever you have, you know, 10, 20, 50.
>
> Finance people, I'm looking at you, 50s, okay.
>
> So please donate.
>
> But now it's about time to bring our last comedian on stage.
>
> Kortiki, are you guys ready?
>
> Give it up. It's Harry Fuchs, everybody.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fuchs.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name is Harry Fuchs.
>
> My name is not Harry Fuchs.
>
> What was that, sir?
>
> Would you like to repeat that?
>
> No, please don't.
>
> Because, you know, in my family, we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halver and Wopper.
>
> But, you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fuchs is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> It's only been about this much fucking--
>
> Okay, honestly, it was that much fucking--
>
> And, you know, recently, it's actually been quite a long time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> What about you, Stan? You've been very horny tonight.
>
> For the rest of it, it seems like we're at the Zurich Nymphomaniacs Anonymous.
>
> So, for you guys, maybe, to help you understand my condition, you know, when you haven't had sex in
>
> a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> You could be walking down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each other's asses.
>
> You look at them and you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, you go into Migros and you spot an action of watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bam! It's like you're in a different dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting steamy, you're oblivious to the
>
> fact people are looking.
>
> And then you hear this, "Junge Mann, schämen Sie sich!"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag and you think, "She's nice."
>
> Woo!
>
> Yeah, that's how it is.
>
> But, you know, recently I've been trying to find more ways to meet people and I got on Instagram.
>
> Now, that took a long time, but, you know, I always thought, the reason for that is, I always
>
> thought that Instagram is just a festering cesspool of narcissists and sociopaths.
>
> But then I was like, "Wait a second. These are my people!"
>
> Oh my God!
>
> But there is one thing about Instagram that still kind of makes me crazy.
>
> In fact, when I see this, I just get filled with anger and depression for the future of humanity.
>
> It's inspirational quotes.
>
> Those inspirational quotes, when I see that on a selfie, my brain just trips out with rage.
>
> And it's like, it starts to make subtitles, invisible subtitles that only I can see.
>
> And if you guys could see them, Instagram would be a whole lot less inspirational.
>
> In fact, I brought a list.
>
> For example, it's like, "Be yourself. There's no one better."
>
> Yeah, maybe 7 billion people would disagree with you.
>
> Or, "If you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine."
>
> What, you cause skin cancer?
>
> "Living my best life!"
>
> That's your best life?
>
> Maybe it's time it came to an end.
>
> "Change is the only constant."
>
> Is that why you're out begging for change?
>
> "Say yes to new adventures."
>
> Okay, so you just got dumped by your boyfriend?
>
> Or, "Live more, worry less."
>
> Yeah, if you could please do that next time you're crossing the road.
>
> Or, "Like a boss of a McDonald's in Dubendorf."
>
> "Working smarter, not harder."
>
> Oh, okay, you just got fired.
>
> "They said I couldn't, and that's why I did."
>
> And that's why you're serving 15 to life.
>
> "Friends are the family you get to choose."
>
> Okay, so if we fuck, it's incest?
>
> "Love..."
>
> I can't even read that.
>
> "I woke up like this."
>
> What, covered in dried semen?
>
> This isn't me, I'm sorry. It's just what's inside me, you know?
>
> "Make 'em stop and stare."
>
> By showing your dick?
>
> "The way you speak to yourself is always so important."
>
> So maybe you should shut the fuck up.
>
> "It's what you do, not what you say you'll do."
>
> Now that one I think Hitler would have agreed with.
>
> In fact, have you ever thought what it would be like if the Nazis had had Instagram?
>
> How they would do that? They would be like...
>
> "Neue Lebensraum!"
>
> Sorry about that Poland joke.
>
> "Ubermensch!"
>
> Or just simply like...
>
> "Sieg Heil!"
>
> Now, did you notice the difference of those and the ones before?
>
> Exactly, because there is no difference. It's just the same shit.
>
> It makes me think, sometimes I think, if I had a time machine and I could go back and meet Hitler,
>
> what would I say to him?
>
> I'd probably be like, "Yo Adolf, things are looking pretty bad for you in the near future."
>
> "But you will not believe what they call the taxi app of the future."
>
> That's right, Uber.
>
> And I wonder, how did they come up with the name Uber?
>
> Uber was founded by two guys called Travis and Garrett.
>
> And probably Travis was like, "We need a name that says we're better."
>
> Like, "Above."
>
> And Garrett was like, "Above? What about something a bit sexier, a bit more European, like Uber?"
>
> And it was just fucking insane.
>
> We should not be letting corporations do anything. It's already fucking up the planet.
>
> They shouldn't get to do it with fascist product names.
>
> Imagine I designed an app for those CrossFit fanatics.
>
> And it's an app to help them get over a hangover, to get all the toxins out of their body.
>
> And I'm like, "What should we call it? Should we call this SweatOut?"
>
> And Garrett comes up to me and says, "SweatOut, we need something sexier, something more European.
>
> Call it Auschwitz."
>
> So people are on Instagram going, "I just Auschwitzed."
>
> It's getting a bit dark here. Should I tell a quick joke about my daughter?
>
> Let's bring the level up a bit tonight.
>
> I'm a single dad. Do we have any other parents here?
>
> Oh, we've got one parent. So maybe you will understand.
>
> See, I'm a single dad. And I have two kids. I have a teenage daughter.
>
> And being a dad with a teenage daughter, I am constantly being confronted with situations I'm
>
> wholly unprepared for.
>
> Like recently, I came back from work, I went in the bathroom, and oh my god, it looked like a crime
>
> scene in there.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror, drops of blood in the sink, more blood on the floor.
>
> And the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around, and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> At that moment, my daughter showed up and she said, "Hey Dad, I got my period!"
>
> So I was like, "Hmm, okay." After cleaning up her menstrual blood, I was like, "Can I get you
>
> something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now obviously this is a job I'm completely unqualified for, but this can't be so hard.
>
> So I went back to me-go, wearing a wig.
>
> And I took a look around, and what I discovered is that tampon product names are exactly no use
>
> whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because you have names like OB-PRO.
>
> This is like for professional women that bleed for a living.
>
> I don't think I want that for my daughter.
>
> What about, oh look, Tampax Radiance. This is like glow-in-the-dark tampons for when the lights are
>
> off.
>
> The one I like the most is called Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product from Always. It's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It is amazing. Really.
>
> Around about ten o'clock it starts to leak. She is always home by eleven.
>
> For me the whole experience as a father, it is a really proud, wonderful fatherhood experience.
>
> Because it's not every day you get to choose what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> Thank you.
>
> And that's it for this week. Thank you.
