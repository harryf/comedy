> Ladies and gentlemen, we've almost made it to the end of tonight, okay?
>
> We have one last comedian left in tonight's show.
>
> Now, before that, I want to tell you guys a couple of things.
>
> First of all, folks, this is a donation-based mic, okay?
>
> This open mic gets promoted through your donations.
>
> So right there at the door, you see Vanessa is holding a little donation box
>
> there.
>
> So please throw in some money so we can continue doing this stuff.
>
> Whatever you have, you know, 10, 20, 50 finance people.
>
> I'm looking at you, 50s, okay?
>
> So please donate.
>
> But now it's about time to bring our last comedian on stage.
>
> Cortica, are you guys ready?
>
> Give it up.
>
> It's Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> When I'm in a room with English speakers like this, a lot of you think my name
>
> is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> Because in my...
>
> What was that, sir?
>
> Would you like to repeat that?
>
> No, please don't.
>
> It is...
>
> You know, in my family, we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halber and Wopper.
>
> But, you know, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very
>
> high level of expectation.
>
> You see, it's only been about this much fucking...
>
> Okay, honestly, it was that much fucking...
>
> And, you know, recently, it's actually been quite a long time since I had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> What about you, Stan?
>
> You've been very horny tonight.
>
> How can you tell?
>
> Okay.
>
> Well, for the rest of it, it seems like we're at the Zurich Nymphomaniacs.
>
> So, for you guys, maybe to help you understand my condition, you know,
>
> when you haven't had sex in a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating,
>
> really.
>
> You could be walking down the street, you see a couple of dogs sniffing each
>
> other's asses.
>
> You look at them and you think, I wish that was me.
>
> Or you go into Migros.
>
> You go into Migros and you spot an acción on water.
>
> Watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> Bam!
>
> It's like you're in a different dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon.
>
> It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy.
>
> You're oblivious to the fact people are looking.
>
> And then you hear this,
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, she's nice.
>
> Yeah, that's how it is.
>
> But, you know, recently I've been trying to find more ways to meet people and I
>
> got on Instagram.
>
> Now, that took a long time, but, you know, I always thought the reason for that
>
> is I always thought that Instagram is just a festering cesspool of narcissists
>
> and sociopaths.
>
> But then I was like, wait a second.
>
> These are my people.
>
> Oh, my God.
>
> But there is one thing about Instagram.
>
> It's still there.
>
> It still kind of makes me crazy.
>
> In fact, when I see this, I just get filled with anger and depression for the
>
> future of humanity.
>
> It's inspirational quotes.
>
> Those inspirational quotes, when I see that on a selfie, my brain just trips
>
> out with rage.
>
> And it's like it starts to make subtitles, invisible subtitles that only I can
>
> see.
>
> And if you guys could see them, Instagram would be a whole lot less
>
> inspirational.
>
> In fact, I brought a list.
>
> For example, it's like, be yourself.
>
> There's no one better.
>
> Yeah, maybe 7 billion people would disagree with you.
>
> Or, if you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine.
>
> What, you call skin cancer?
>
> Skin cancer?
>
> Living my best life.
>
> If that's your best life, maybe it's time it came to an end.
>
> Change is the only constant.
>
> Is that why you're out begging for change?
>
> Say, oh, I can't even wait.
>
> Say yes to new adventures.
>
> Okay, so you just got dumped by your boyfriend?
>
> Or, uh, live more, worry less.
>
> Yeah, if you could please do that next time you're crossing the road.
>
> Or, uh, like a boss of a McDonald's in Dubendorf.
>
> Working smarter, not harder.
>
> Oh, okay, you just got fired.
>
> They said I couldn't, and that's why I did.
>
> And that's why you're serving 15 to life.
>
> Friends are the family you get to choose.
>
> Okay, so if we fuck, it's incest?
>
> Love, oh, I can't even read that.
>
> I woke up like this.
>
> What, covered in drugs?
>
> Bride semen?
>
> This is, this is me, I'm sorry.
>
> It's just what's inside me.
>
> You know, make him stop and stare.
>
> By showing your dick?
>
> The way you speak to yourself is always so important.
>
> So maybe you should shut the fuck up.
>
> It's what you do, not what you say you'll do.
>
> Now, that one I think Hitler would have agreed with.
>
> In fact, have you ever thought what it would be like
>
> if the Nazis had had Instagram?
>
> How they would do that?
>
> They would be like,
>
> Neuer Lebensraum!
>
> Sorry about that, Poland.
>
> Übermensch!
>
> Or just simply like,
>
> Sieg Heil!
>
> Now, did you notice the difference of those and the ones before?
>
> Exactly, 'cause there is no difference, it's just the same shit.
>
> And you know, it makes me think, sometimes I think, you know,
>
> if I had a time machine and I could go back and meet Hitler,
>
> what would I say to him?
>
> I'd probably be like, yo, Adolf,
>
> things are looking pretty bad for you in the near future.
>
> But you will not believe what they call a taxi.
>
> That's the app of the future.
>
> That's right, Uber.
>
> And I wonder, how did they come up with the name Uber?
>
> Because Uber was founded by two guys called Travis and Garrett.
>
> And probably Travis was like, we need a name, we need a name that says we're
>
> better, you know, like, above.
>
> And Garrett was like, above, hmm, what about something a bit sexier, a bit more
>
> European, like Uber.
>
> And it was just fucking insane, you know.
>
> We should not be letting corporate money get to us.
>
> We should not be letting corporate money get to us. We should not be letting
>
> corporate money get to us.
>
> We should not be letting corporate money get to us. We should not be letting
>
> corporate money get to us.
>
> doing it. They're already fucking up the planet. They shouldn't get to do it
>
> with fascist product
>
> names. Like imagine like I designed an app for those CrossFit fanatics, you
>
> know, and
>
> it's like an app to help them get over a hangover, you know, to like get all
>
> the toxins out of
>
> their body. And I'm like, what should we call it? Should we call this Sweat Out?
>
> And Garrett
>
> comes up to me and says, Sweat Out, we need something sexier, something more
>
> European.
>
> I'm calling it Auschwitz. I'm calling that thing Auschwitz. Pretty soon people
>
> are on
>
> Instagram going, I just Auschwitzed. Yeah, exactly. Okay, it's getting a bit
>
> dark here.
>
> Should I tell a quick joke about my daughter? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, so let's
>
> bring the level
>
> up a bit tonight. So, you know, I'm a single. Do we have any other parents here?
>
> Oh, we
>
> got one parent. Okay, so maybe you will understand. See, I'm a single dad and I
>
> have two
>
> kids. I've had a teenage daughter. And being a dad with a teenage daughter, I
>
> am constantly
>
> being confronted with situations I'm wholly unprepared for. Like recently, I
>
> came back
>
> from work. I went in the bathroom and oh my God, it looked like a crime scene.
>
> There was
>
> a bloody handprint on the mirror. Drops of blood in the sink. More blood on the
>
> floor.
>
> The toilet looked like something from a horror movie. And then I heard a
>
> screaming and I
>
> looked around and I realized the screaming was coming from me. At that moment,
>
> my daughter
>
> showed up and she said like, hey dad, I got my period. So I was like, okay,
>
> after cleaning
>
> up her menstrual blood, I was like, can I get you something? And she's like,
>
> dad, get
>
> me tampons.
>
> Now, obviously this is a job I'm completely unqualified for. This can't be so
>
> hard. So
>
> I went back to Migo wearing a wig. And I took a look around and what I
>
> discovered is that
>
> tampon product names are exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a
>
> tampon. Because
>
> you have names like OB Pro.
>
> This is like for professional women that believe in women.
>
> I don't think I want that for my daughter. What about, oh look, Tampax Radiance.
>
> This
>
> is like glow in the dark tampon. For when the lights are on. The one I like the
>
> most
>
> is called Always Infinity. For when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.
>
> Oh my God.
>
> But, I ended up, I ended up choosing another product from Always. It's called
>
> Always Home
>
> by Eleven. It is amazing.
>
> Around about 10 o'clock it starts to leak. She is always home by eleven.
>
> And for me, the whole experience as a father, it is a really proud, wonderful
>
> fatherhood
>
> experience because it's not every day you get to choose what your daughter crams
>
> into.
>
> Thank you.
>
> And that's the end of today's interview.
>
> Thank you.
>
> That was very funny.
>
> Thank you very much.
