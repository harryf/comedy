<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> One last comedian left, okay?
>
> We're very happy to get him here.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, the headliner of tonight.
>
> This guy is the sexiest guy in Zurich comedy.
>
> This is his real name, everybody.
>
> Give him a big round of applause.
>
> It's Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> Give it up.
>
> So, my name is actually Harry Fox.
>
> It's a German name.
>
> Spelled F-U-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-U-C-K-S.
>
> But in a room with English speakers like this,
>
> I don't know what you think my name is.
>
> My name is Harry Fox.
>
> My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids.
>
> I had to call them Halver and Wotther.
>
> But you see the real problem, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox
>
> is it sets a very high level of expectation.
>
> And honestly, I've really only done about this much fucking.
>
> But honestly, it was...
>
> In fact, recently, if I can share this with you,
>
> it has been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Okay, we have IT people here.
>
> There's more at the back, they're lying.
>
> Julian here's hoping he can end a long dry spell.
>
> *laughter*
>
> But it looks like Victoria's been having a lot of fun on Tinder recently.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Oh dear.
>
> But, you know, maybe I need to explain this to these guys
>
> because this seems to be the Zurich nymphomaniacs on this meter.
>
> *laughter*
>
> So to help you guys understand my condition and all the rest of you,
>
> you know, when you haven't had sex for a long time,
>
> it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Because, you know, you could be like walking down the streets
>
> and you see a couple of dogs and they're sniffing each other's asses.
>
> *laughter*
>
> And you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> *laughter*
>
> Or you go into Migo, you spell an acción on watermelon.
>
> *laughter*
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two, *bang*
>
> it's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> *laughter*
>
> It's just you on that watermelon, it's getting hot, it's getting steamy,
>
> you're oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this voice saying, "You're my man's shaman, Zizek!"
>
> *laughter*
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with her handbag
>
> and you think, "She's nice."
>
> *laughter*
>
> So that's how it is for me.
>
> *laughter*
>
> But you know, actually, recently something strange happened.
>
> Because I was walking down Bar Neshtar, over there in the cool part of Zurich
>
> where the hipsters live.
>
> And this young man came past me on his bicycle, on his hipster bicycle.
>
> And he looked me in the eye and did this.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Now, at first, I was actually kind of impressed.
>
> He was right next to the tram tracks.
>
> He pulled that off without wiping out.
>
> *laughter*
>
> But then I thought, "Wait a second, this young man is completely right."
>
> *laughter*
>
> Because I am a first-class masturbator.
>
> *laughter*
>
> My hand and my penis is a love affair of over 40 years.
>
> *laughter*
>
> It's longer than most of you have been on the planet.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Okay, there's Alex here.
>
> *laughter*
>
> His is in retirement.
>
> I understand that.
>
> *laughter*
>
> But, you know, and actually, when I think about it, like, my hand, you know, it
>
> just knows amazing things about my penis.
>
> And it's reached the point that sometimes if I go on a date with a woman, I
>
> think, "She's kind of cute. But could she be my hand?"
>
> *laughter*
>
> Because my hand is not trying to post every moment on Instagram.
>
> My hand doesn't want to take me to brunch.
>
> *laughter*
>
> My hand is not hoping for babies one day.
>
> *laughter*
>
> So when I look at my hand, I just think, "It's kind of perfect."
>
> Like, if I bring it together with the other, I've got a ten.
>
> *laughter*
>
> But, you know, it's kind of a strange situation to be in because, you know, I've
>
> actually started to think at this point in my life, "Maybe, maybe I don't
>
> actually need a woman."
>
> Now, that's a shocking concept, but, you know, I have to give you a bit of
>
> context because I'm actually a single father.
>
> I have two teenage kids. They live with me. I have a career. I do comedy.
>
> Where am I going to fit a woman into this hectic schedule of working and
>
> parenting and jacking off?
>
> *laughter*
>
> You know, and recently, I went to this parents' evening with my son.
>
> And I met this single mum, and when I told her I'm a single dad, she
>
> immediately started to tell me how to cook pasta.
>
> *laughter*
>
> And I thought, "Oh my God, this asshole is mumsplaining me right now."
>
> *laughter*
>
> But I didn't say that, of course. I was like, "Hmm, okay. That's a very
>
> interesting pasta tip."
>
> *laughter*
>
> But then she said something to me that blew my mind. She said, "Maybe."
>
> "Just maybe, you need a woman in your life."
>
> And I thought to myself, "Hmm, that's very interesting. And maybe it isn't you."
>
> *laughter*
>
> And you see, you know, this is kind of the situation I'm in because, you know,
>
> I've been in a long-term relationship for almost 20 years.
>
> And, you know, it was a breakup a year ago. And, you know, actually when I
>
> think about it,
>
> I have a lot of experience what it's like to live with women.
>
> And I have to say that living with a woman is hard.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Okay, I'm setting a lot of tension in this room.
>
> *laughter*
>
> There's a lot of tension. There are boyfriends with a girl like, "Don't tell
>
> her. Don't tell her. This row at the front is glaring."
>
> *laughter*
>
> No, but let me just say this. Let me just say this. I don't hate women. I think
>
> women are wonderful.
>
> But living with a woman is kind of hard.
>
> It's kind of like living with a werewolf.
>
> Because once a month, your darling, your beautiful woman will transform into
>
> this terrifying monster.
>
> There's going to be blood everywhere, and she's growling at you because you put
>
> a sock in the wrong drawer.
>
> *laughter*
>
> Alright, we're going to have a few of the guys that are going to fight for
>
> their rights laughing.
>
> I need all the support right now.
>
> I'm terrified at this moment.
>
> Because, you know, actually the thing that
>
> gets me now is, you know, living singly, like, once I got used to it, I'm
>
> actually starting to kind of like it.
>
> Because, you know, in the evening, if I want to do something, I just do it.
>
> It's incredible. It's like 20 years. I couldn't do this. Now I can just do it.
>
> I'm no longer spending my evenings on the sofa watching romantic comedies.
>
> A new girl. I got to watch The Punisher on the day it came out.
>
> It's reached the point where, you know, when I'm standing there in front of my
>
> toilet with the seat up and I'm feeling that warm, wet, freedom spray hitting
>
> my legs,
>
> I just think, "I'm living a dream right now. I'm living it."
>
> Alright, so, judging from the faces of all the women, I'm going to need an
>
> escort from all the guys here to leave this place safely.
>
> Maybe I can wrap this up with
>
> a more friendly, a joke that might appeal more to you ladies.
>
> Because, you know, I am a single dad and I have a teenage daughter and she
>
> matters a lot to me.
>
> But being a single dad with a teenage daughter, I am constantly being
>
> confronted with situations I'm just not prepared for.
>
> Like recently, I came back from work. I went into the bathroom and, oh my god,
>
> it looked like a crime scene.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror.
>
> Drops of blood in the sink, more blood on the floor and the toilet looked like
>
> something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming and I looked around and I realized the screaming
>
> was coming from me.
>
> And at that moment, at that moment, my daughter turned up and she said, "Hey
>
> dad, I got my period."
>
> And I was like, okay. After cleaning up her menstrual blood, I said,
>
> "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> And I thought, obviously as a man I'm not qualified for this at all, but I
>
> thought this can't be so hard.
>
> So I went over to Migros again, wearing the wig.
>
> And I took a look around and what I discovered is that tampon product names are
>
> exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because they have names like OB Pro.
>
> Like, what is this, for professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> I don't think I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> We're talking like, what, glow-in-the-dark tampons, so when the lights are off?
>
> I'm just confused.
>
> One I thought was very creative was Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfittable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product by Always Infinity.
>
> It's actually called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It is amazing.
>
> Around about 10 o'clock it starts to leak and she is always home by eleven.
>
> And for me this whole experience as a father, it was a very positive one, I was
>
> very proud.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose what your daughter crams in
>
> her vagina.
