<h2><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Transcript</h2>

> Last comedian left, okay? We're very happy to get him here.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, the headliner of tonight, this guy is the sexiest guy in Zurich comedy.
>
> This is his real name, everybody. Give him a big round of applause.
>
> It's Harry Fox, everybody! Give it up!
>
> So my name is actually Harry Fox. It's a German name, spelled F-O-C-K-S.
>
> I repeat, F-O-C-K-S. But in a room with English speakers like this,
>
> a lot of you think my name is Harry Fox. My name is not Harry Fox.
>
> And in my family, when we have a family get-together,
>
> we get very upset when you call us a group of fuckers.
>
> And I have two kids. I had to call them Halver and Whather.
>
> But you see, the real problem with a name like Harry Fox is it sets a very high level of
>
> expectation.
>
> And honestly, I've really only done about this much fucking, but honestly it was...
>
> In fact, recently, if I can share this with you, it has been a long time since I've had sex.
>
> Put your hands up if you haven't had sex in a long time.
>
> Okay, we have IT people here. There's more at the back of their line.
>
> Julian here is hoping he can end a long dry spell.
>
> But it looks like Victoria's been having a lot of fun on Tinder recently.
>
> But you know, maybe I need to explain this to these guys,
>
> because this seems to be the Zurich Nymphomaniacs anonymous heater.
>
> So to help you guys understand my condition and all the rest of you,
>
> you know, when you haven't had sex for a long time, it's kind of like you're hallucinating.
>
> Because, you know, you could be like walking down the streets and
>
> you see a couple of dogs and they're sniffing each other's asses.
>
> And you think, "I wish that was me."
>
> Or you go into Migros, you spell an "acción" on watermelon.
>
> You get one hand on that watermelon, maybe two.
>
> It's like you're in a new dimension.
>
> It's just you and that watermelon. It's getting hot.
>
> It's getting steamy. You're oblivious to all the people watching.
>
> And then you hear this voice saying, "You got my enchantments!"
>
> And you look and there's an old lady about to hit you with a handbag.
>
> And you think, "She's nice."
>
> So that's how it is for me.
>
> But, you know, actually, recently something strange happened.
>
> Because I was walking down Bahnerstrasse,
>
> like over there in the cool part of Zurich where the hipsters live.
>
> And this young man came past me on his bicycle, on his hipster bicycle.
>
> And he looked me in the eye and did this.
>
> Now, at first, I was actually kind of impressed because he was right next to the tram tracks.
>
> He pulled that off without wiping out.
>
> But then I thought, "Wait a second. This young man is completely right."
>
> Because I am a first-class masturbator.
>
> My hand and my penis is a love affair of over 40 years.
>
> It's longer than most of you have been on the planet.
>
> Okay, there's Alex here.
>
> His is in retirement, I understand.
>
> But, you know, and actually when I think about it, like my hand, you know,
>
> it just knows amazing things about my penis.
>
> And it's reached the point that sometimes if I go on a date with a woman,
>
> I think, "She's kind of cute, but could she be my hand?"
>
> Because my hand is not trying to post every moment on Instagram.
>
> My hand doesn't want to take me to brunch.
>
> My hand is not hoping for babies one day.
>
> So when I look at my hand, I just think, "It's kind of perfect."
>
> Like, if I bring it together with the other, I've got a 10.
>
> But, you know, it's kind of a strange situation to be in because,
>
> you know, I've actually started to think at this point in my life,
>
> "Maybe, maybe I don't actually need a woman in my life."
>
> You know, that's a shocking concept.
>
> You know, I have to give you a bit of context because I'm actually a single father.
>
> I have two teenage kids.
>
> They live with me.
>
> I have a career.
>
> I do comedy.
>
> Where am I going to fit a woman into this hectic schedule
>
> of working and parenting and jacking off?
>
> You know, and recently, I went to this parents' evening at my son's school.
>
> And I met this single mum.
>
> And when I told her I'm a single dad,
>
> she immediately started to tell me how to cook pasta.
>
> And I thought, "Oh my God, this asshole is mumsplaining me right now."
>
> But I didn't say that, of course.
>
> I was like, "Hmm, okay, that's a very interesting pasta tip."
>
> But then she said something to me that blew my mind.
>
> She said, "Maybe, just maybe, you need a woman in your life."
>
> And I thought to myself, "Hmm, that's very interesting.
>
> And maybe it isn't you."
>
> And you see, you know, this is kind of the situation I'm in
>
> because, you know, I've been in a long-term relationship for almost 20 years.
>
> And, you know, it was a breakup of kind of a year ago.
>
> And, you know, actually, when I think about it,
>
> I have a lot of experience of what it's like to live with women.
>
> And I have to say that living with a woman is hard.
>
> Okay, I'm sending a lot of tension in this room.
>
> There's a lot of tension.
>
> There are boyfriends with a girl like, "Don't tell her, don't tell her.
>
> This row at the front is glaring."
>
> No, but let me just say this.
>
> Let me just say this.
>
> I don't hate women.
>
> I think women are wonderful.
>
> But living with a woman is kind of like living with a werewolf.
>
> Because once a month, your darling, your beautiful woman,
>
> will transform into this terrifying monster.
>
> There's going to be blood everywhere.
>
> And she's growling at you because you put a sock in the wrong drawer.
>
> All right, we're going to have a few of the guys,
>
> like, they're going to fight for their rights, laughing.
>
> We're going to need all the support right now.
>
> I'm terrified at this moment.
>
> Because, you know, actually, the thing that gets me now is, you know, living singly.
>
> Like, once I got used to it, I actually started to kind of like it.
>
> Because, you know, in the evening, if I want to do something, I just do it.
>
> It's incredible.
>
> It's, like, 20 years.
>
> I couldn't do this.
>
> Now I can just do it.
>
> I'm no longer spending my evenings on the sofa watching romantic comedies.
>
> And you go, I got to watch The Punisher on the day it came out.
>
> Yeah, and it's reached the point where, you know,
>
> when I'm standing there in front of my toilet with the seat up,
>
> and I'm feeling that warm, wet, freedom spray hitting my face,
>
> I just think, I'm living a dream right now.
>
> I'm living it.
>
> All right, so judging from the faces of all the women,
>
> I'm going to need an escort from all the guys here to leave this place safely.
>
> Maybe I can wrap this up with a more friendlier,
>
> a joke that might appeal more to you ladies.
>
> Because, you know, I am a single dad, and I have a teenage daughter,
>
> and she matters a lot to me.
>
> But being a single dad with a teenage daughter,
>
> I am constantly being confronted with situations I'm just not prepared for.
>
> Like recently, I came back from work.
>
> I went into the bathroom, and oh my god, it looked like a crime scene.
>
> There was a bloody handprint on the mirror,
>
> drops of blood in the sink,
>
> more blood on the floor,
>
> and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.
>
> And then I heard a screaming, and I looked around,
>
> and I realized the screaming was coming from me.
>
> And at that moment, at that moment, my daughter turned up,
>
> and she said, "Hey dad, I got my period."
>
> And I was like, okay, after cleaning up her menstrual blood,
>
> I said, "Hey, can I get you something?"
>
> And she said, "Dad, get me tampons."
>
> Now I thought, obviously as a man, I'm not qualified for this at all,
>
> but I thought this can't be so hard.
>
> So I went over to Mika again, wearing the wig,
>
> and I took a look around,
>
> and what I discovered is that tampon product names
>
> are exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.
>
> Because they have names like OB-PRO.
>
> Like, what is this?
>
> For professional women that bleed for a living?
>
> I think I want that for my daughter.
>
> Or Tampax Radiance.
>
> We're talking like, what, glow-in-the-dark tampons?
>
> When the lights are off?
>
> I'm just confused.
>
> One I thought was very creative was Always Infinity.
>
> For when your vagina is an unfitable black hole.
>
> But I ended up choosing another product by Always.
>
> It's actually, it's called Always Home by Eleven.
>
> It is amazing.
>
> Round about 10 o'clock, it starts to leak,
>
> and she is always home by eleven.
>
> And for me, this whole experience as a father,
>
> it was a very positive one.
>
> I was very proud.
>
> Because it's not every day that you get to choose
>
> what your daughter crams in her vagina.
>
> All right.
>
> Security, can someone escort me out of the building, please?
>
> All right.
>
> Ladies, just forget this ever happens.
>
> Just have a nice dream tonight, and it will all be over.
>
> Thank you, guys.
>
> You've been a lot of fun.
>
> That was Harry Fox, everybody.
>
> Give it up again for him.
>
> Yes.
>
> Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it to the end of the Starz X Comic Con.
