  - text: 'And the other thing is, obviously, I actually need to fuck a lot. And that hasn''t really been'
  - text: 'happening.'
  - text: 'Although, to say I''m actually a father and a single dad, I have two teenagers, so just enough'
  - text: 'happened for my genes to pass to another generation.'
  - text: 'I have these two teenagers, and I call them Halver and Wopper.'
  - text: 'And as a single dad, I''m always being confronted with situations I''m wholly unprepared for.'
  - text: 'For example, recently I came back from work, and I went into the bathroom, and oh my God, it looked'
  - text: 'like a crime scene in there.'
  - text: 'There was bloody hand print on the mirror, there was blood in the sink, drops of blood on the floor,'
  - text: 'and the toilet looked like something from a horror movie.'
  - text: 'And then I heard this screaming, and I looked around, and I realized the screaming was coming from'
  - text: 'me.'
  - text: 'And at that point, my daughter showed up, and she said, "Hey, Dad, I got my period!"'
  - text: 'And after cleaning up my daughter''s menstrual blood, she said, "Hey, can I get you something?"'
  - text: 'And my daughter was like, "Dad, get me tampons."'
  - text: 'Now, as a man, I obviously know completely nothing about buying tampons, but I thought, "Hey, this'
  - text: 'can''t be so hard."'
  - text: 'So I went to Medro, I took a look around, and what I learned is that tampon product names are'
  - text: 'exactly no use whatsoever when it comes to choosing a tampon.'
  - text: 'For example, you have names like OB-PRO, like professional women that bleed for a living.'
  - text: 'Or Tampax Radiance, glow-in-the-dark tampons for when the lights are off.'
  - text: 'The one I like the most is Always Infinity, for when your vagina is an unfillable black hole.'
  - text: 'Anyway, it worked out okay, I chose something, it worked out fine for my daughter, and for me, it'
  - text: 'ended up being a very proud moment as a father.'
