  - text: 'Gotta work this one through.'
  - text: 'So, yeah, but that''s actually not the worst part'
  - text: 'of if you go around there,'
  - text: 'because what you may not have realized'
  - text: 'is that when a woman is there,'
  - text: 'like going, pressing out a baby,'
  - text: 'a baby''s not the only thing coming out of there.'
  - text: 'And in fact, it could be, if you go around there,'
  - text: 'the first image of your newborn, your flesh and blood,'
  - text: 'is of its head resting on a pile of shit.'
  - text: 'Now, for the women here,'
  - text: 'don''t feel uncomfortable about this.'
  - text: 'It''s okay.'
  - text: 'The nurses will come and wipe your ass for you.'
  - text: 'But this is the type of stuff I''m talking about.'
  - text: 'I just know too much about this.'
  - text: 'In fact, sometimes when I see a group of women,'
  - text: 'you know like when you see a group of women and their friends'
  - text: 'and one of them''s just got a newborn,'
  - text: 'and they''re like, "Oh, so sweet, so cute.'
  - text: '"I just love the way babies smell."'
  - text: 'Now, I hate to break it to you,'
  - text: 'but that is not the smell of a baby.'
  - text: 'That is the smell of something'
  - text: 'that just spent nine months in your friend''s vagina.'
  - text: 'And the correct thing that you should be saying is,'
  - text: '"Oh, I just love the smell of your pussy."'
  - text: 'So, you know, I have these dark thoughts'
  - text: 'when I see these happy moments, these baby showers,'
  - text: 'because this whole thing has kind of left me'
  - text: 'a bit traumatized.'
  - text: 'I have a lot of weird thoughts going on in my head.'
