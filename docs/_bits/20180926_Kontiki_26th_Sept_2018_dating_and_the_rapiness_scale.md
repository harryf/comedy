  - text: 'And it''s difficult for me dating, because you may not have realized, it''s like a kind of a scale.'
  - text: 'It''s like a scale, and I call this the rapiness scale.'
  - text: 'Over here you''ve got maybe serial rapists, and over here you''ve got the friend zone.'
  - text: 'And every time a guy talks to a girl, this calculation is going on in our heads.'
  - text: 'It''s like, "Where am I going to position myself on the rapiness scale?"'
  - text: 'I don''t want to be in the friend zone. I''ve got to be a bit more edgy than that.'
  - text: 'Like a lot of nice guys, they''re trying to push it this way.'
  - text: 'I''m going this way.'
  - text: 'I''m trying to be as nice as I can.'
  - text: '"Wow, wow, wow, that''s a really nice dress you have on."'
  - text: 'It doesn''t matter what I do though, it just comes across as serial rapist.'
