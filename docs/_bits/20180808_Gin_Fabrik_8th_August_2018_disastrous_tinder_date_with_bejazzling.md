  - text: 'But yeah, it hasn''t actually all been going so badly.'
  - text: 'Recently I had, let''s say, a close encounter thanks to Tinder.'
  - text: 'I went on a date with the lady, it went very well.'
  - text: 'We went back to her place, one thing led to another.'
  - text: 'And, you know, just to help you visualize, I was kind of going down,'
  - text: 'and I was kind of, like, tumbling her breasts and was kissing her stomach.'
  - text: 'And I pulled her panties down and found a cluster of diamonds.'
  - text: 'And I said, "Hey, what are these diamonds doing here?"'
  - text: 'And it turned out that actually this lady was bejazzled.'
  - text: 'Now, you may not know what bejazzling is,'
  - text: 'but bejazzling actually was invented in the year 2012 by Beyonce.'
  - text: 'And it''s the act of when a woman has shaped her pubic mound to look like a ten-year-old.'
  - text: 'It''s then to stick some gemstones on there, like some emeralds, some rubies, some diamonds.'
  - text: 'And then the word bejazzle means vagina and dazzle.'
  - text: 'So, as a guy pulls down the pants and the light strikes those gemstones, you are dazzled.'
  - text: 'Unfortunately, I was not dazzled. Not at all.'
  - text: 'Because I said, "Listen, I''m sorry, but this is over right now.'
  - text: 'These are blood diamonds.'
  - text: 'You put them in the biggest mining company at incredible human suffering and cost.'
  - text: 'You can''t do this."'
  - text: 'And that, unfortunately, was the end of the evening.'
